"https://ethglobal.com/showcase/librenews-pdsxu","LibreNews","ETHGlobal Bangkok","2025","Libre News is a censorship-resistant news feed designed to ensure that news remains unalterable, unrestricted, and transparently accessible. Also it provides a mobile application which is a perfect way to present censorship-resistant news feed.","Access to information in our time is one of the cornerstones of freedom. However, censorship and restrictions by centralized authorities threaten this fundamental right. News is published, but often taken down later due to bans or restrictions, cutting people off from vital information.
That’s exactly the problem Libre News aims to solve! 🗞️
Libre News is a censorship-proof mobile news streaming app designed to ensure that once shared, news remains unalterable and permanently accessible.. Our system breaks the chains of censorship and ensures that information stays free. How does it work?
Fetching News with RSS Feeds: We pull data from news websites in real time, keeping the original content intact.
Verification with Digital Signatures: Each news item is verified with digital signatures to prove its authenticity. These signatures are turned into attestations and stored immutably on the Polygon, ensuring no one can alter or delete the information.
Decentralized Storage: Using Filecoin, we securely store all news data on decentralized networks, making sure it remains safe and accessible even during censorship.
Why Libre News?
Libre News is more than just a news feed—it’s a defender of freedom. Here’s why it matters:
Immutability: Every news item is protected with a cryptographic timestamp, ensuring it can never be tampered with.
Access Freedom: Even if the internet is blocked, the news remains accessible through our system.
Transparency and Trust: Our platform guarantees the authenticity of information, building trust in the content you see.
We stand for people’s right to access information and challenge centralized censorship systems.
Our mission is not only to preserve news but also to redefine how information is shared. Libre News is leading the fight for a censorship-free world.","N/A","https://github.com/itublockchain/ethbangkok-team2","The process begins with collecting news in real time using RSS feeds from trusted sources. These feeds allow the system to fetch the latest content directly from news websites, preserving it exactly as it was published. This ensures that no external interference or manipulation can affect the content before it enters our system.
Once the news is collected, it undergoes a verification process using digital signatures with Sign Protocol. Each article is hashed to generate a unique digital fingerprint and then signed with a cryptographic key. This signature acts as proof of the content’s authenticity and integrity, making it impossible to alter the news without detection. The verified news is then transformed into an attestation—a cryptographic record that includes the timestamp and verification details—and stored immutably on the Polygon. This integration ensures that the news cannot be manipulated or removed, creating a permanent and transparent record.
To further protect against censorship, all news data is stored on Filecoin, a decentralized storage network. Even if certain parts of the network are blocked or taken down, the news remains accessible from other nodes.
Finally, users can access the news through a mobile application built with React Native, offering a user-friendly experience. The app interacts directly with Filecoin’s decentralized storage to retrieve news, ensuring seamless access even in cases of internet censorship.
This integrated system ensures that Libre News not only shares information but safeguards its freedom, authenticity, and accessibility, making it a reliable solution against censorship and manipulation.","['Avail-Pool Prize: Build anything with Avail']"

Enterprise features This tool significantly reduces the friction in Web3 development by providing a complete, production-ready development environment that works seamlessly with the Hedera ecosystem. Whether you're building a simple dApp or a complex DeFi platform, BitLayer Stack CLI provides the foundation you need to focus on building your application rather than setting up infrastructure.","https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-hederaevm-app","https://github.com/AllenAJ/create-hedera-app","BitLayer Stack CLI is built using Node.js and TypeScript, leveraging key packages like Commander.js for CLI interaction and Inquirer.js for interactive prompts. At its core, the tool executes a series of automated steps when you run the create command. It first initializes a new Next.js project using the create-next-app command, configuring it with TypeScript and TailwindCSS by default. Then, it sets up a Foundry environment in a contracts directory for smart contract development, installing necessary dependencies like OpenZeppelin. The tool automatically injects Web3 dependencies (Reown, wagmi, and viem) into the Next.js project's package.json and copies pre-configured template files that include ready-to-use React components for wallet connection and network switching. For Hedera integration, it adds custom configuration files and environment variables preconfigured for the Hedera Testnet. The entire process is orchestrated through a modular system of utility functions that handle file operations, dependency management, and error handling. The tool maintains a template directory structure that includes boilerplate code, components, and configurations, which are copied and customized based on user input during project creation. Each step is executed sequentially with proper error handling and user feedback through a progress spinner, making the entire process seamless and user-friendly. The result is a fully configured development environment where developers can immediately start building dApps on Hedera without dealing with complex setup procedures.","N/A"

"https://ethglobal.com/showcase/keyboardwallet-8abdz","KeyboardWallet","ETHGlobal Bangkok","2025","We are integrating your wallet insinde of your keyboard to make payment as easy as sending an emoji","This project is designed to simplify the user experience of making digital payments by leveraging account abstraction, the capabilities of ERC-4337 (often called EIP-4337, which powers account abstraction), and the future ERC-7702 standards for payment sessions and automation. Here’s how it works in detail:
1.	Account Setup and Funding:
•	The user can deposit funds from any Layer 2 (L2) blockchain network using any supported currency, which will then be automatically swapped to USDC on the Base blockchain network. This simplifies the experience, as users don’t have to manage currency conversions manually or worry about switching networks.
•	This auto-swap mechanism allows users to fund their account in a streamlined way, depositing in a familiar currency and having it converted to USDC in the background.
2.	Session Key for Payments:
•	Once the user has deposited funds into their account, they can generate a “sessionKey.” This session key is a temporary access key that enables secure, quick, and easy payments directly from a keyboard extension.
•	During the hackathon prototype phase, this session key is hosted on a server to simplify interactions, allowing the keyboard to manage the signature of transactions through JavaScript. However, in the final production version, the session key will be managed on-device to enhance security, with signature handling at the native level on the device.
3.	Keyboard Extension for Payments:
•	The keyboard extension becomes a versatile payment tool with two main functions:
•	Request: Allows the user to generate a payment request link directly from the keyboard. This feature is useful for receiving payments without leaving a messaging app or switching contexts.
•	Send: Enables users to quickly initiate a payment, specifying the amount and using the session key to authenticate the transaction seamlessly.
•	With the session key and on-device signature management, transactions can be completed smoothly within the messaging or app interface, making the payment experience as simple as sending a message.
4.	User Experience Goals:
•	Simplicity: By hiding the complexities of currency conversion, network switching, and cryptographic signing, users can have a familiar experience akin to traditional finance apps while using the advantages of blockchain.
•	On-Device Security: In the final product, signatures are managed directly on the user’s device, ensuring that keys aren’t exposed externally and adding a layer of trust for users concerned about security.
•	Seamless Integration: The keyboard acts as a gateway to digital transactions, enabling users to send or request funds anywhere they can type, such as in social media, messaging apps, or other communication tools.
5.	Future Improvements and Standards:
•	Leveraging ERC-7702 (a forthcoming standard), this project is preparing for automated payments and session-based account interactions, enabling the creation of secure, limited-use keys like the sessionKey. This is particularly useful for applications needing temporary access, such as for recurring payments or one-off transactions. In essence, the project makes sending and receiving money as easy as using your keyboard. Through account abstraction, automatic currency swapping, session keys, and secure on-device signature handling, it eliminates the technical friction typically associated with blockchain payments, offering a clean and user-friendly payment experience that can be used in any app where the keyboard is available.","N/A","https://github.com/GianlucaMinoprio/keyboard-wallet-ethglobal","By leveraging Zerodev for smart wallet management and combining web and native technologies, we achieved an integrated payment solution.

Verifiable reputation, seamless events, and a step closer to redefining consensus. 🌟 #NFCare #ProofOfHelp #BlockchainInnovation","NFCare is a seamless solution for managing and verifying real-world assistance at large-scale events like hackathons and conferences. By leveraging NFC technology and blockchain, NFCare streamlines the process of help requests and reputation tracking. Here's how it works: NFC Technology: Attendees use NFC tags or wristbands, which serve as their unique digital identities. When help is needed, users tap their NFC tag on a reader at their table, broadcasting their request. Help Notifications: The tapped NFC triggers an automated request, notifying mentors or helpers assigned to specific tables. Mentors receive real-time data such as the attendee’s name, seating location, and social handles (e.g., Telegram) to directly engage. Proof of Help: Once assistance is provided, attendees tap their mentor's NFC tag to rate their experience. This action generates a unique digital signature (Proof of Help), attested on-chain using the Sign Protocol, associating the request ID, signature, and Ethereum address. Reputation System: Ratings collected build a verifiable, immutable reputation score for mentors. These scores are stored on the blockchain, enabling event organizers to incentivize mentors based on their proven contributions. Consensus Redefined: NFCare introduces a new type of consensus — Proof of Help, which validates meaningful, real-world actions on the blockchain, moving beyond traditional energy-intensive models like Proof of Work.","N/A","https://github.com/adielliot37/ethglobal-BKK","N/A","['Blockscout-Blockscout Explorer Big Pool Prize']"
