https://ethglobal.com/showcase/librenews-pdsxu,LibreNews,ETHGlobal Bangkok,2025,"Libre News is a censorship-resistant news feed designed to ensure that news remains unalterable, unrestricted, and transparently accessible. Also it provides a mobile application which is a perfect way to present censorship-resistant news feed.","Access to information in our time is one of the cornerstones of freedom. However, censorship and restrictions by centralized authorities threaten this fundamental right. News is published, but often taken down later due to bans or restrictions, cutting people off from vital information.
That’s exactly the problem Libre News aims to solve! 🗞️
Libre News is a censorship-proof mobile news streaming app designed to ensure that once shared, news remains unalterable and permanently accessible.. Our system breaks the chains of censorship and ensures that information stays free. How does it work?
Fetching News with RSS Feeds: We pull data from news websites in real time, keeping the original content intact.
Verification with Digital Signatures: Each news item is verified with digital signatures to prove its authenticity. These signatures are turned into attestations and stored immutably on the Polygon, ensuring no one can alter or delete the information.
Decentralized Storage: Using Filecoin, we securely store all news data on decentralized networks, making sure it remains safe and accessible even during censorship.
Why Libre News?
Libre News is more than just a news feed—it’s a defender of freedom. Here’s why it matters:
Immutability: Every news item is protected with a cryptographic timestamp, ensuring it can never be tampered with.
Access Freedom: Even if the internet is blocked, the news remains accessible through our system.
Transparency and Trust: Our platform guarantees the authenticity of information, building trust in the content you see.
We stand for people’s right to access information and challenge centralized censorship systems.
Our mission is not only to preserve news but also to redefine how information is shared. Libre News is leading the fight for a censorship-free world.",N/A,https://github.com/itublockchain/ethbangkok-team2,"The process begins with collecting news in real time using RSS feeds from trusted sources. These feeds allow the system to fetch the latest content directly from news websites, preserving it exactly as it was published. This ensures that no external interference or manipulation can affect the content before it enters our system.
Once the news is collected, it undergoes a verification process using digital signatures with Sign Protocol. Each article is hashed to generate a unique digital fingerprint and then signed with a cryptographic key. This signature acts as proof of the content’s authenticity and integrity, making it impossible to alter the news without detection. The verified news is then transformed into an attestation—a cryptographic record that includes the timestamp and verification details—and stored immutably on the Polygon. This integration ensures that the news cannot be manipulated or removed, creating a permanent and transparent record.
To further protect against censorship, all news data is stored on Filecoin, a decentralized storage network. Even if certain parts of the network are blocked or taken down, the news remains accessible from other nodes.
Finally, users can access the news through a mobile application built with React Native, offering a user-friendly experience. The app interacts directly with Filecoin’s decentralized storage to retrieve news, ensuring seamless access even in cases of internet censorship.
This integrated system ensures that Libre News not only shares information but safeguards its freedom, authenticity, and accessibility, making it a reliable solution against censorship and manipulation.",['Avail-Pool Prize: Build anything with Avail']

At its core, the tool executes a series of automated steps when you run the create command. It first initializes a new Next.js project using the create-next-app command, configuring it with TypeScript and TailwindCSS by default. Then, it sets up a Foundry environment in a contracts directory for smart contract development, installing necessary dependencies like OpenZeppelin. The tool automatically injects Web3 dependencies (Reown, wagmi, and viem) into the Next.js project's package.json and copies pre-configured template files that include ready-to-use React components for wallet connection and network switching. For Hedera integration, it adds custom configuration files and environment variables preconfigured for the Hedera Testnet. The entire process is orchestrated through a modular system of utility functions that handle file operations, dependency management, and error handling. The tool maintains a template directory structure that includes boilerplate code, components, and configurations, which are copied and customized based on user input during project creation. Each step is executed sequentially with proper error handling and user feedback through a progress spinner, making the entire process seamless and user-friendly. The result is a fully configured development environment where developers can immediately start building dApps on Hedera without dealing with complex setup procedures.",N/A

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/keyboardwallet-8abdz,KeyboardWallet,ETHGlobal Bangkok,2025,We are integrating your wallet insinde of your keyboard to make payment as easy as sending an emoji,"This project is designed to simplify the user experience of making digital payments by leveraging account abstraction, the capabilities of ERC-4337 (often called EIP-4337, which powers account abstraction), and the future ERC-7702 standards for payment sessions and automation. Here’s how it works in detail:
1.	Account Setup and Funding:
•	The user can deposit funds from any Layer 2 (L2) blockchain network using any supported currency, which will then be automatically swapped to USDC on the Base blockchain network. This simplifies the experience, as users don’t have to manage currency conversions manually or worry about switching networks.
•	This auto-swap mechanism allows users to fund their account in a streamlined way, depositing in a familiar currency and having it converted to USDC in the background.
2.	Session Key for Payments:
•	Once the user has deposited funds into their account, they can generate a “sessionKey.” This session key is a temporary access key that enables secure, quick, and easy payments directly from a keyboard extension.
•	During the hackathon prototype phase, this session key is hosted on a server to simplify interactions, allowing the keyboard to manage the signature of transactions through JavaScript. However, in the final production version, the session key will be managed on-device to enhance security, with signature handling at the native level on the device.
3.	Keyboard Extension for Payments:
•	The keyboard extension becomes a versatile payment tool with two main functions:
•	Request: Allows the user to generate a payment request link directly from the keyboard. This feature is useful for receiving payments without leaving a messaging app or switching contexts.
•	Send: Enables users to quickly initiate a payment, specifying the amount and using the session key to authenticate the transaction seamlessly.
•	With the session key and on-device signature management, transactions can be completed smoothly within the messaging or app interface, making the payment experience as simple as sending a message.
4.	User Experience Goals:
•	Simplicity: By hiding the complexities of currency conversion, network switching, and cryptographic signing, users can have a familiar experience akin to traditional finance apps while using the advantages of blockchain.
•	On-Device Security: In the final product, signatures are managed directly on the user’s device, ensuring that keys aren’t exposed externally and adding a layer of trust for users concerned about security.
•	Seamless Integration: The keyboard acts as a gateway to digital transactions, enabling users to send or request funds anywhere they can type, such as in social media, messaging apps, or other communication tools.
5.	Future Improvements and Standards:
•	Leveraging ERC-7702 (a forthcoming standard), this project is preparing for automated payments and session-based account interactions, enabling the creation of secure, limited-use keys like the sessionKey. This is particularly useful for applications needing temporary access, such as for recurring payments or one-off transactions. In essence, the project makes sending and receiving money as easy as using your keyboard. Through account abstraction, automatic currency swapping, session keys, and secure on-device signature handling, it eliminates the technical friction typically associated with blockchain payments, offering a clean and user-friendly payment experience that can be used in any app where the keyboard is available.",N/A,https://github.com/GianlucaMinoprio/keyboard-wallet-ethglobal,"By leveraging Zerodev for smart wallet management and combining web and native technologies, we achieved an integrated payment solution.

Match, chat, and reveal identities only when ready. Powered by Oasis blockchain for top-notch privacy, Hancock offers secure, meaningful, and exciting connections.","Hancock is an innovative and privacy-first dating platform that redefines how people connect online. Its primary focus is ensuring users feel secure, anonymous, and in control of their interactions, breaking away from the traditional norms of online dating. Key Features and Workflow
Anonymous Profiles
Unlike conventional dating apps, Hancock does not reveal user identities immediately. When users sign up, they create a profile that remains anonymous. This profile highlights interests, preferences, and other general attributes, but it does not include identifiable details like names or photos. This anonymity ensures that users are judged based on their personality and interests rather than appearances. Swiping Mechanism
Users browse through profiles and swipe based on the details provided. The swiping interface resembles popular dating apps, offering a sense of familiarity while emphasizing privacy. Mutual Matches
If two users swipe right on each other, they form a match. At this stage, they can begin chatting anonymously within the app. This layer of interaction allows them to build a rapport and understand each other without pressure. Identity Reveal
Here’s where Hancock stands out: identities remain hidden even after a match. Users can continue chatting anonymously for as long as they want. If both parties feel comfortable and mutually agree, they can reveal their real identities. This step ensures that users progress at their own pace, fostering trust and meaningful connections. Technology Used:",N/A,https://github.com/Kaushikh76/hancock,"Oasis Network
The backbone of Hancock's privacy-focused design is the Oasis Network, which specializes in secure, decentralized applications. Initially, we explored using tools like Privy and Dynamic Wallet, but these presented significant challenges. Transitioning fully to the Oasis Network streamlined our development process, as it provided robust privacy-preserving features out of the box. It allowed us to ensure data encryption, secure identity management, and verifiable privacy measures. This decision also enabled faster development cycles while maintaining high standards of security. Frontend: React Native
The app's interface was built using React Native, chosen for its ability to create cross-platform apps efficiently. React Native allowed us to maintain a consistent user experience on both iOS and Android devices, but it wasn’t without its hurdles. Debugging issues that arose “left, right, and center” pushed us to deeply understand React Native’s inner workings, especially when integrating custom components and handling platform-specific quirks. Custom Functionality with Privy
Implementing Privy was one of the most technically challenging and rewarding aspects of the project. To make Privy work seamlessly with our app’s architecture, we had to override existing functions and write custom replacements tailored to our needs. This hacky yet effective approach helped us extend Privy's capabilities, and it became a major learning experience. These customizations ultimately aligned with our goal of ensuring end-to-end privacy for our users. Challenges and Solutions
Dynamic Wallet Integration
Initially, integrating Dynamic Wallet posed significant hurdles, especially in aligning its functionality with the app’s privacy requirements. Troubleshooting and debugging consumed substantial time. However, when we shifted focus entirely to the Oasis Network, it proved to be a game-changer. Oasis offered a more cohesive and scalable solution for handling user data securely, significantly simplifying the development process. React Native Limitations
While React Native was instrumental in quickly building a polished and performant app, it wasn’t without its challenges. Issues like inconsistent behavior between platforms and occasional crashes during testing were common. Careful debugging, testing across multiple devices, and leveraging community-driven solutions helped us overcome these obstacles. Despite the headaches, it proved invaluable for its flexibility and rapid development capabilities. Custom Learning Through Hacks
One of the standout ""hacks"" involved rewriting core functionality to extend existing tools like Privy.

That means owning the items you earn within games, obtaining new items from outside of the game or from different seemingly unrelated games to use in game. This is important because too often you spend countless hours as a gamer on one game, grinding achievements, acquiring rare loot, only to then move on to the next game and start from scratch. Or worse swill, when a game studio decides to shut down/patch their game to oblivion, leaving you with nothing to show for all of the time you spent playing. Metaloot solves this by enabling game devs to launch from Metaloot and utilize the Flow Chain (game items are NFTs on Flow and player account is a Flow account abstraction account) and Metaloot API to create custom on chain game logic, allow players to own items, and because Metaloot is a platform, enabling players to take those items into different games. Metaloot is a Desktop Application that runs a server in a separate thread, allowing devs to connect to Flow from within their games also running on Desktop. Metaloot is a launchpad for games which can utilize Metaloot's API and the Flow Blockchain to encode items/events as NFTs, giving players the ownership of their in game items and making them sharable cross games. MetaLoot is a comprehensive platform built entirely on the Flow blockchain, leveraging Cadence smart contracts to enable seamless integration of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), gaming sessions, and a marketplace. Our project includes three key smart contracts that work together to provide a robust, decentralized gaming ecosystem: MetaLootNFT Contract: Conforms to the NonFungibleToken standard on Flow, ensuring compatibility and adherence to blockchain standards for NFTs.
GameSessions Contract: Manages active and historical game sessions, linking them to individual user addresses and storing session states securely on-chain.
Marketplace Contract: Facilitates NFT listing and sales, providing a decentralized space for trading NPC and in-game NFTs.
How It Works
GameSessions Smart Contract The GameSessions smart contract is the backbone of the gaming experience on MetaLoot. Here's how it functions: Starting a Session: A game session begins automatically when a user launches a game on MetaLoot. The contract initializes the session and stores the user’s address.
Session Management: Users can:
Add items to their inventory during gameplay.
Extend the session for as long as they wish without fear of losing progress, even in the event of connection interruptions. The session's state is securely stored on-chain, ensuring data integrity.
Ending a Session: When the user decides to end the game:
The GameSessions Contract automatically creates NFT items representing the session’s outcome.
These NFTs are minted and deposited directly into the user’s wallet.
Only after this process is the game session marked as ended.
This design ensures a seamless and worry-free gaming experience, with all progress immutably stored on the blockchain. Marketplace Contract The Marketplace contract provides a user-friendly and secure way to list and trade NFTs. Here's how it works: Listing an NFT:
Users can list any NFT they own by providing its ID and proving ownership.
The Marketplace contract stores the listing in a structured format, linking the NFT ID to metadata or any additional details required for the sale.
Purchasing an NFT:
When a buyer initiates a purchase, the Marketplace contract triggers a transferNFT function:
The NFT is transferred from the original owner to the buyer.
Ownership is updated in the MetaLootNFT Contract.
The NFT is withdrawn from the original user's account, deposited into the buyer's account, and removed from the Marketplace listing.
This process ensures transparency, efficiency, and security for all marketplace transactions. NPC 3D-Model NFTs MetaLoot includes unique NPC 3D-Model NFTs, where the actual 3D model files (in .glb format) are securely stored on FileChain. These files are accessible only to the rightful owner of the NFT. Key features include: NFT Ownership Validation: Only verified owners can download the .glb file via an accessible link.
FileChain Integration: The use of FileChain ensures that high-value assets are protected and remain accessible to the appropriate parties.
Key Features
On-Chain Game Session Management: State-preserving sessions that prevent data loss and enhance the gaming experience.
NFT Creation and Minting: Automatic generation and minting of session-based NFTs, directly deposited into user wallets.
Decentralized Marketplace: A secure and efficient trading platform for NPCs and in-game items.
Exclusive 3D Content: Rights-protected access to .glb files for NPC NFTs, providing real-world utility for token ownership.
Technical Highlights
Built on the Flow blockchain, leveraging its developer-friendly environment and Cadence's resource-oriented programming.
State persistence and seamless NFT management ensure users retain control over their in-game progress and digital assets.
Designed to integrate gaming, trading, and ownership into a unified, decentralized ecosystem.
MetaLoot redefines gaming on the blockchain, blending decentralized asset management with unparalleled user experience.",https://github.com/Complexia/metaloot-eth,https://github.com/Complexia/metaloot-eth,"How It’s Made Metaloot is a Desktop Application build with Tauri Apps. The serverside of the application is Rust and that's where the API server is running (multithreaded so as not to hang the rest of the operations). Games can call this API from inside of their games. The frontend of the appliation is NextJS. that's where the connections and transactions to the flow is made. rust gets api called from games, it emits events, frontend picks up on events, executes txns based on event body, and call s rust back to give data back to the game. MetaLoot was crafted entirely on the Flow blockchain using Cadence, Flow's resource-oriented smart contract language. We embraced Flow's developer-friendly architecture and ecosystem to build a gaming platform that is decentralized, seamless, and scalable. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how we pieced it all together: Core Technologies
Flow Blockchain:
Provides the foundation for the entire project, leveraging its high performance and low latency to handle game state management, NFT minting, and marketplace operations.
Built with scalability and usability in mind, Flow enabled us to focus on the application logic without worrying about the underlying blockchain constraints.
Cadence:
The project was written 100% in Cadence, Flow’s resource-oriented smart contract language.
Cadence’s resource model was particularly beneficial for:
Ensuring the security of NFTs by treating them as unique resources.
Preventing accidental duplication or loss of NFTs and game session data.
All contracts (MetaLootNFT, GameSessions, and Marketplace) were written to maximize composability and reusability.
FCL (Flow Client Library):
Used in our frontend to interact with Cadence smart contracts.
FCL provided seamless wallet integration for transactions like starting game sessions, minting NFTs, and listing assets on the marketplace.
FileChain:
Integrated for decentralized file storage of NPC 3D models (.glb files).
Ensured that asset files were securely stored and accessible only to rightful NFT owners via verifiable links.
IPFS:
Used for NFT metadata storage, ensuring decentralization and immutability.
Metadata included links to FileChain-hosted .glb files and session-generated NFTs.
How the Pieces Fit Together
Smart Contracts MetaLootNFT Contract:
Implements Flow’s NonFungibleToken standard to manage ownership and transfer of NFTs.
Designed to support complex metadata, such as 3D model links and attributes.
Used for minting session-based NFTs and NPC 3D models.
GameSessions Contract:
Tracks active and historical gaming sessions for each user.
Stores game state on-chain to prevent progress loss due to disconnections.
Generates NFTs automatically when a session ends, depositing them directly into the user’s wallet.
Marketplace Contract:
Implements listing and trading functionality for NFTs.
Ensures secure ownership validation before processing sales.
Automates NFT transfer between users, linking seamlessly with the MetaLootNFT contract.
Frontend Built using React for an intuitive and responsive user interface.
FCL enabled wallet integration, allowing users to connect their Flow wallets and interact with the platform.
The frontend dynamically fetches and displays NFTs and marketplace listings using Flow queries.
File Handling FileChain: Stores large .glb files for NPC NFTs.
IPFS: Hosts metadata for in-game items, session NFTs, and marketplace listings.
Links to files are stored in smart contracts, ensuring they are always accessible via decentralized systems.
Hacky and Notable Features
On-Chain Game State Persistence:
Implemented a system where game session states are saved on-chain in real-time. This prevents users from losing progress even if their connection drops unexpectedly.
Hacky Aspect: We utilized Cadence’s resource-oriented model to create lightweight, session-specific storage units, ensuring minimal on-chain overhead while maintaining scalability.
Dynamic NFT Minting:
NFTs are dynamically generated at the end of each game session, with metadata reflecting session-specific details like game achievements or earned items.
Hacky Aspect: We used Cadence’s ability to handle composable resources to mint multiple NFTs simultaneously for a single session.
File Access Control:
NPC 3D models are accessible only to rightful NFT owners. File access links are dynamically generated and verified via smart contract interactions.
Hacky Aspect: We tied the NFT ownership logic directly to FileChain, ensuring seamless access control without requiring centralized verification.
Composable Contracts:
All three contracts were designed to interact with each other seamlessly. For example:
The Marketplace contract interacts with the MetaLootNFT contract to validate ownership before executing a trade.
The GameSessions contract directly triggers NFT minting in MetaLootNFT upon session completion.
Why Flow and Cadence?
Scalability:
Flow’s architecture (Execution Nodes, Collection Nodes, etc.) handles high transaction throughput efficiently, making it ideal for gaming and NFT operations.
Developer Experience:
Cadence’s clarity and resource-oriented design made it easier to implement complex features like session management and NFT minting.

Here’s how everything fits together: Technologies Used:
TypeScript & Telegram Bot API: The bot was developed using TypeScript for type safety and structured code, with the Telegram Bot API handling user interactions and commands.
Ethers.js: We used Ethers.js for interacting with the Ethereum smart contracts on Base Sepolia, enabling on-chain registration of AI agent Basenames.
Redis: Redis was employed for caching and storing chat data, enabling fast lookups and seamless session management.
Dynamic: We integrated Dynamic for payments and user authentication. This allowed us to provide a streamlined payment experience directly within the Telegram chat, making it easy for users to make payments without complex wallet interactions.
Nillion: Nillion was used for secure key management. We leveraged Nillion’s decentralized storage API to store and retrieve private keys securely, enhancing the privacy and security of user credentials.
Base (Coinbase): We registered human-readable Basenames for AI agents on Base Sepolia, enabling unique and recognizable identifiers tied to each wallet address.
How It All Works Together:
Chat Initialization: When a user starts the bot, we create a new wallet using Ethers.js, store the private key using Nillion’s API, and fund the wallet.
The bot then registers a human-readable Basename (e.g., brave-eagle-agent.basetest.eth) on Base Sepolia, giving the user a unique on-chain identity.
Payment Integration with Dynamic: Dynamic’s API is used for seamless payment processing. When a user initiates a booking request, they can easily complete the payment using Dynamic, which handles the user authentication and transaction flow.
AI Agent Registration: We used the Basename registration on Base Sepolia to create on-chain AI agents. These agents can interact with users based on the Basename, creating a unique identity tied to the wallet address.
Secure Key Storage with Nillion: To ensure the privacy of user credentials, private keys are encrypted and stored using Nillion’s decentralized storage API. This approach allowed us to avoid storing sensitive data on centralized servers, enhancing security.
Notable Hacky Solutions:
Mocking Transactions for Testing: Since we needed to test the full flow without spending actual ETH during development, we used a local testnet setup and mocked the payment responses from Dynamic’s API to simulate successful transactions.
Dynamic Agent Names: We implemented a dynamic agent name generation system using a combination of adjectives and nouns (e.g., brave-eagle-agent). This approach ensured that every registered Basename was unique and human-readable, adding a fun twist to the project.
Redis-Powered Session Management: We used Redis to handle chat data and session management, allowing us to persist user data across sessions efficiently and avoid losing state in a multi-user environment.
This combination of technologies and integrations allowed us to build a comprehensive, decentralized event coordination and payment bot that enhances the user experience while maintaining security and privacy.","['Blockscout-Blockscout Explorer Big Pool Prize', 'Coinbase Developer Platform-OnchainKit Pool Prize', 'Coinbase Developer Platform-CDP SDK Pool Prize']"

It aims to integrate the concept of decentralized public benefits by leveraging the open and community-driven ethos of the Nouns ecosystem. The platform provides a structured, onchain tracking system that monitors users' engagement in wellness activities. Each participant can join live sessions hosted on the platform, which supports three core daily habits: 20 minutes of exercise, 20 minutes of meditation, and 20 minutes of reading. The platform tracks user activity, recording when they log in, the specific activities they engage in, and the duration of each task. Upon completing their daily routines, users can make an ""attestation""—a verifiable acknowledgment of their completed activities, recorded on the blockchain. The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) currently serves as a conceptual representation of the platform's future vision. The design and branding are inspired by the Nouns community, conveying a playful, public-good ethos that aligns with the project's goals of fostering wellness as a shared benefit. This initial version focuses on demonstrating the tracking capabilities, user interface, and activity flow that will later be fully developed into a more comprehensive platform.",https://www.comunidadparkway.com/challenge-page/5amsociety,https://www.comunidadparkway.com/challenge-page/5amsociety,"The project employs a combination of blockchain technology, frontend development, and wellness activity tracking tools. Here's a breakdown of the components and technologies that can be involved (While the MVP only showcases a simplified version of what The Nounish Society aspires to be, it serves as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the platform's potential to integrate decentralized technology with everyday wellness, creating a space where personal growth is verifiable, transparent, and a shared experience.): Blockchain Integration: The core feature of the platform is onchain activity tracking, which is achieved using a public blockchain. Each activity is logged and timestamped on the chain, ensuring transparency, traceability, and immutability. The MVP likely uses Ethereum or a similar blockchain that supports smart contracts and public attestation.
Smart contracts are utilized to manage attestations, recording when users complete their daily routines. This also allows for future scalability, such as introducing incentives, rewards, or a reputation system for consistent engagement.
Frontend Design: The user interface is inspired by the Nouns ecosystem, which is known for its clean, playful, and minimalist style. This design choice helps communicate the platform's mission as a public good, emphasizing accessibility and community involvement.
The frontend is likely developed using React.js or a similar modern JavaScript framework, allowing for responsive and interactive user experiences during live sessions and activity tracking.
Backend and Database: The backend handles user authentication, live session management, and storing session data temporarily before it is recorded onchain. This might involve a combination of Node.js and Express.js for the server-side logic.
A database solution, such as Firebase or MongoDB, could be used to store non-critical, user-related data, like progress over time or session history, that doesn't need to be stored permanently onchain.
Onchain Attestations: At the end of each session, users can perform an onchain attestation through a smart contract. This records their daily participation and ensures that the platform remains a trustworthy source of wellness data.
Web3.js or Ethers.js libraries are used to facilitate blockchain interactions directly from the frontend, allowing users to seamlessly connect their digital wallets and perform transactions/attestations.
Live Session Management: Live sessions are conducted on the platform, with a simple video or streaming service integration. Tools like Zoom API or Jitsi can be integrated for real-time communication.
The platform tracks when users join the session, what activities they perform, and how long they stay active, enabling accurate and reliable data for the attestations. Nouns Design Integration
The Nouns brand is a unique and recognizable ecosystem within the NFT and decentralized space, characterized by its minimalist and playful style. The aesthetic, commonly represented by ""Nouns""—characters composed of simple pixel art traits—is more than just a visual signature; it symbolizes community-driven values, transparency, accessibility, and the power of open collaboration. Here’s how these elements are woven into the Nounish Society platform: Values of the Nouns Brand
Public Good Ethos: The Nouns brand embodies the idea of the ""public good,"" emphasizing contributions that benefit everyone without exclusion. By basing the Nounish Society on this ethos, the platform aims to create a space where personal growth becomes a communal experience, fostering a shared sense of well-being. Simplicity and Inclusivity: Nouns are known for their simplicity—pixel art characters with a straightforward design, making them easy to replicate and accessible. This simplicity is reflected in the Nounish Society's user experience, where wellness activities are clearly structured, easy to track, and inclusive for all users, regardless of their background or familiarity with blockchain technology. Transparency and Decentralization: Nouns thrive on transparency, operating through open governance and decision-making processes. The Nounish Society integrates this transparency by using blockchain technology to record wellness activities, making them traceable and verifiable. This aligns with the decentralized nature of the Nouns community, where all interactions are publicly visible and accountable. Playfulness and Community: A core value of Nouns is the playful spirit, which encourages creativity, fun, and joy in everyday actions. The Nounish Society embraces this playfulness, not only in its visual branding but in the platform’s approach to personal growth—turning daily routines into an engaging, community-driven experience. Visual Representation in the Logo
The Nounish Society's logo is carefully designed to incorporate these values through specific visual elements: Sunset Motif: The sunset, as a symbol, represents personal growth, renewal, and the promise of a new day. It reflects the platform's goal to encourage users to continually improve and embrace new habits. The sunset evokes a sense of optimism and transition, paralleling the journey of self-improvement and well-being that the platform promotes.
The logo's color palette, likely warm hues of oranges, reds, and purples, echoes the colors of a sunset, bringing a sense of calm, encouragement, and motivation to users.
Noogles (Nouns Glasses): The noogles—iconic glasses from the Nouns characters—are a direct nod to the Nouns community, symbolizing the connection between the Nounish Society and its broader cultural roots. This element ties the project to the larger ethos of open collaboration and public good, indicating that personal growth is not a solitary journey but a shared one.
Body Shaped Like a Sunset: The body of the character, resembling the curve of a sunset, underscores the holistic nature of personal growth. It conveys a feeling of completeness and harmony, symbolizing how daily habits contribute to a balanced life.
This design choice captures the essence of continuity and gradual progress, as sunsets are cyclical—mirroring how the platform encourages users to embrace daily routines as part of an ongoing journey.
By integrating these specific traits, the Nounish Society's logo not only connects visually with the Nouns ecosystem but also resonates with deeper values of growth, transparency, playfulness, and community. This design acts as a beacon, signaling that personal transformation, like a sunset, is both a daily achievement and part of a larger cycle—a process that the whole community can engage in together.",N/A

Current Web3 applications suffer from a fundamental UX problem. Users face complicated interfaces, confusing workflows, and the constant need to switch between multiple platforms. This creates a significant barrier between mainstream users and the innovative potential of blockchain technology. Both creators and their audiences are missing out, simply because the tools are too complex to use. Our Solution:
We're transforming how people interact with Web3 by bringing it directly to where they already are. Instead of forcing users to learn new platforms, we integrate crypto capabilities seamlessly into their existing digital spaces. Why It Matters:
Social media represents the next frontier for Web3 adoption. By embedding blockchain functionality directly into these familiar platforms, we're eliminating the traditional barriers to entry. Users don't need to understand the complex blockchain processes happening behind the scenes - they can simply interact with Web3 features as naturally as they would like, share, or retweet. Beyond Single-Chain Limitations:
While previous attempts at blockchain integration (like Solana's Blinks) showed promise, they were restricted to single-chain ecosystems. We've built a solution that transcends these limitations, supporting all major blockchains.

In its highest ambition, InnoPolis is a platform for enabling collective intelligence in human societies and fostering mutual understanding at scale. Original Polis is a system that allows people to submit statements about an issue, and vote on each other's statements (agree/disagree/pass). At the end of a round, it identifies the different major ‘clusters’ in the different points of view, and surfaces the statements that were the most effective at getting support from all clusters. In other words, it helps with finding major points of consensus and disagreement between participants. Although Polis has been successfully used as a deliberation tool in several countries (e.g., Taiwan, Germany, Uruguay, and others), it currently lacks meaningful integration into web3 environments. Decentralizing Polis through InnoPolis involves the following changes:
• authentication for participating in a survey is conducted via web3-wallets, including web3auth integration
• the survey creator can set custom participation requirements based on any arbitrary criteria: for example, participants might need to hold a minimum number of tokens (e.g., >100 Chiliz fan-tokens), own specific NFTs (e.g., Nouns NFTs), demonstrate active participation in governance (e.g., frequent voting on Snapshot), or verify their humanity using World ID
• all data (statements and votes) is stored on-chain, ensuring transparency and enabling anyone to access and analyze the results
• incentives for participation can be introduced by the survey creator, encouraging engagement In web3 space, “community” is arguably the most overused word. Everyone claims their community/users are a top priority, but only a few truly understand what their community/users think.

As chronic crypto conference attendees and hackers, we all know the Luma side event pain too well. Our calendars are way too cluttered, there are 5 bajillion side events happening at the same time, and we’re probably spending more time trying to decide what event to go to than actually enjoying the event itself. There’s no easy way to put it - the Luma side event experience is COOKED. At Devcon 2024, there were 928 side events. There are so many events happening at the same time, how is one supposed to decide which to go to? Sometimes good events are too far and the traffic is abominable. Sometimes we’re just looking for good food or swag but maybe they ran out already. Sometimes the venue is way too packed and other times it’s completely dead. Sometimes all we want are good networking vibes but it’s mainly the company hosting doing a massive product shill. And maybe sometimes we actually want to do what we’re supposed to be here for and listen in on a good technical talk or panel lineup. But who’s gonna let you in on this alpha? Introducing Lively on Luma: real-time ratings on which Luma side events are poppin’ or floppin’. On our app, users can scroll around a map and tap on different pins that show the different Luma events that they’re registered for. For events they’re at or have already popped by that day (if Luma QR code has already been scanned indicating they were checked in), they’ll be able to rate them (upvote or downvote) based on different factors: overall, food, fun, swag, networking, and technical. To decide on what event to go to, they can scope around the different pins and see everyone’s combined ratings for that event. This makes it a personalized experience, as different people might prioritize different things at side events (e.g. good food or good talks). Why blockchain? By having this on-chain, we ensure that all ratings are valid and given by humans (not bots) and that there is no centralized power that can pay to promote their own event (like how sponsored ads are pushed to the top on Google). We wanted to build this hackathon project because this is a real problem that we and all of our friends can relate to, and give back to the web3 ecosystem to help make everyone’s conference experience better. For next steps, we want to be able to add an add friends feature, so that you’ll be able to see which events your friends are currently at and meet up with them.

Here are the key technical details and technologies used in its development: Technologies and Their Role:
Smart Contracts with Solidity The core functionality, including prediction submissions, pool management, and reward distribution, is implemented in Solidity.
It employs mapping structures and arrays to manage user predictions and daily participants efficiently.
Oracle Integration with Chronicle The Chronicle oracle is used to fetch the ETH/USD price data securely and reliably.
Chronicle was selected for its strong reputation and robust price data feed system, ensuring accuracy and fairness in the competition.
Ethereum Blockchain The Ethereum mainnet (or testnet during development) is the backbone of the application, ensuring decentralized and immutable operation.
Event-driven Architecture Solidity events are utilized to log key actions like new predictions and winner announcements. This design facilitates integration with a front-end and provides transparency for participants.
Custom Interfaces Two interfaces, IChronicle and ISelfKisser, enable smooth interactions with the Chronicle oracle and its access manager, abstracting external dependencies.
How the Technologies Are Pieced Together:
The Chronicle oracle is integrated using its custom interface to fetch ETH/USD price data, which drives the winner selection mechanism.
Participants interact with the contract directly via Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask), submitting predictions along with ETH stakes.
The contract processes submissions, calculates winners based on the closest match to the oracle's data, and handles reward distribution seamlessly.
Ownership controls are implemented for administrative functions like emergency winner selection or contract management.
Hacky or Noteworthy Aspects:
Dynamic Oracle Authentication The integration with ISelfKisser for oracle self-authentication (via the selfKiss method) ensures dynamic and secure access management, making the contract robust and scalable.
Optimized Daily Reset Instead of complex off-chain handling, the _resetDay function efficiently resets the state variables for a new day, minimizing gas costs while ensuring correctness.
Flexibility for Immediate Winner Selection An emergency winner selection mechanism (selectWinnerImmediately) allows the owner to intervene when necessary, ensuring operational continuity in edge cases.
The combination of these technologies and design principles makes EthPricePrediction a highly efficient, secure, and engaging platform for ETH price speculation, showcasing the power of blockchain and oracles in gamified financial applications.","['Blockscout-Blockscout Explorer Big Pool Prize', 'Chronicle Protocol-Chronicle Pool Prize']"

In some jurisdictions, rent is paid upfront in 1-year sums, because both the tenant and landlord do not trust each other and the sum is a guarantee that the tenant will not break furniture / overstay on unpaid rent. At the same time, new expats / migrants moving to new cities may not have opened a bank account, or have sufficient cashflow in-hand to make 1-year payment sums.  In effect, this creates sufficient friction when finding a new property for the tenant - he would either have to take a loan from his company, or hop between places / hotels until he has opened a bank account + raised sufficient cashflow to rent a sustainable place of his choice. We believe in giving autonomy back to both the tenant, and assurance of payments to the landlord.  Our solution utilises smart contracts and stablecoins to ensure the smooth processing of multiple recurring payments - the smart contract locks a two-month instead of a one-year fiat collateral, ready to be withdrawn in the case of a default, by the landlord.  On the side of the tenant, the tenant would have the ability to leverage the growing trend of cross-border stablecoin transfer businesses (or any ERC-20 coin for that matter) into the smart contract from offshore, thereby allowing the user to pay for his rent while forgoing the need to open a bank account in the region.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/ino-1qwkb,INO,ETHGlobal Bangkok,2025,INO revolutionizes NFT launches using multi-Vickrey auctions: More Fair pricing and true market valuations.,"INO is an innovative platform that addresses one of the most critical challenges in the NFT space: determining the optimal initial pricing for NFT collections. By implementing a sophisticated multi-Vickrey auction mechanism (aka Uniform Price auction), our solution creates a fair, efficient, and economically sound pricing discovery process for NFT launches. The NFT market currently struggles with significant price volatility and inefficient pricing during collection launches. New collections often face the dilemma of either being undervalued, failing to reach their true market potential, or being overpriced, resulting in unsold NFTs. This leads to a poor experience for both creators and collectors INO introduces a systematic auction-based approach for NFT collection launches. Creators can launch their NFT collection (e.g., 100 unique items) through our platform using a multi-Vickrey auction system. In this mechanism, all winners pay the same price: the highest non-winning bid. For example, in a collection of 100 NFTs, the top 100 bidders win, but all pay the 101st highest bid price. During minting the winners are randomly assigned an NFT from the collection.
The bidding process takes place within a specified time window, ensuring transparent and fair participation through smart contract-based execution. This approach not only provides real-time bid tracking but also ensures that the final price is determined by genuine market demand.
For creators, INO delivers optimal price discovery for their collections, enhancing new collections' launch credibility. While collectors benefit from fair pricing based on true market demand.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/anonymous-social-uwufz,anonymous-social,ETHGlobal Bangkok,2025,A social network platform where users are verified to meet criterions without revealing their real identity.,"Anonymous social is a project designed to explore privacy in a social network setting. In social media applications nowadays, privacy is minimal and users are often easily doxxed simply from their profile. We believe privacy should be a right users have access to and that good meaningful conversations can be had without revealing who you exactly are. What do we mean by this? Imagine you're browsing Reddit, a social forum, and you come across a subreddit called /r/wallstreetbets. Wallstreetbets is a subreddit known for rampant speculation and users talking about their recent trades, often without showing proofs of these trades. So who can you believe is telling the truth and who is lying? It is next to impossible right now on Reddit, and other social platforms, without having the user upload directly a copy of their recent trades, which would immediately dox most of their identity. Using TEEs and ZKPs, we now are able to achieve private computations which isolate (private) user input to generate proofs of any data! Combine these technologies with an attestation protocol and we have a synergistic private compute stack that allows us to verify certain properties about ourselves we want to make known and hide the others that we do not. In the proof-of-concept for Anonymous Social, we implemented a proof of ticket from ETHGlobal using Email Proofs to verify that a user had received the email invitation with the ticket from ETHGlobal to attend ETHGlobal Bangkok. We transport the original email as an encrypted file using the public key from Phala Network's TEE to maintain user privacy and only the TEE knows and does the computation on the email to pre-process it and run the Email Proof from vlayer.xyz, and then post it on-chain using Sign Protocol. In this process, user details are not shared with anyone but the TEE and data can be assumed to a high degree to not have been leaked. While in the short time span of this hackathon we only managed to implement verification of invitation to ETHGlobal Bangkok, there are countless of things users can prove about themselves. For example, we can have communities comprised of traders where there is a required amount of returns over time that need to be verified before allowing entry to the community. This data to compute returns is almost never shared publicly due to privacy reasons and with TEE + ZK secure computations, we can ask the user for such data with the confidence to never leak it. This allows us, as well as users, to create dynamic communities with trust that a person they are speaking to have certain qualities, all while not revealing their full identity!",https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YyHrULyPaYDYIvskf9VnejBJgUBG0PjSvFKaWfUOiHM/edit?usp=sharing,https://github.com/anonymous-social,"To create a seamless onboarding experience, we use Dynamic's wallet kit. Specifically, we needed a wallet kit that allowed a user to sign easily through any identity they preferred, with a blank wallet being the most secure in terms of privacy as there would be no traces of identity other than the wallet address. The frontend is created as a generic NextJS project using shadcn components and serves as the user interface to interact easily with our Email Proof + TEE backend. When a user chooses to upload their.emlfile, in a production setting, Phala Network's API would encrypt the data at rest before sending it over to the TEE, in which the backend is running, and decrypt it there. Once the.emlfile is received in the backend, it is decrypted and pre-processed to verify using Email Proofs from vlayer.xyz. When the Email Proof from vlayer returns as successful, the TEE then makes a create attestation call to the Sign Protocol contracts to upload this attestation for our platform (and others) to use. The current documentation for these sponsors are lacking a little in detail, which is expected as they are relatively new and putting out new APIs for us to use. However, this meant that a majority of my project was very difficult/otherwise impossible to deploy without partner integrations. As such, the demo that I have only runs locally. A hacky solution I found for running vlayer through the TEE is to have some ports exposed between the host and the Docker container to allow http access. Some further hacky work that needed to be done was to edit the public package for vlayer's sdk within the node_modules because the current iteration is not working as expected.",N/A

This invisible onboarding process ensures that even those who have never interacted with blockchain can participate without confusion or friction. For seasoned Web3 users, the platform offers flexibility with support for stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, ensuring an inclusive experience. Foodiverse uniquely demonstrates the practicality of blockchain technology by solving real-world problems. Traditional payment systems are plagued by high fees, delays, and intermediaries, all of which are eliminated through Foodiverse’s use of the Polygon network. Transactions are fast, cost-efficient, and secure, benefitting both diners and restaurant owners. The platform’s token-based loyalty program further showcases the potential of Web3, allowing users to earn and redeem rewards while engaging with a decentralized economy. What makes Foodiverse the best way to onboard users to Web3 is its universality and simplicity. Dining is a daily activity that cuts across demographics, geographies, and economic backgrounds. By embedding Web3 functionality into this familiar context, Foodiverse reaches users where they already are, making blockchain technology accessible and relevant. The addition of ENS integration, with personalized .foodi.eth and .foodiverse.eth names, enhances the experience by introducing a human-readable layer to blockchain interactions, making Web3 feel approachable and practical. With its combination of a user-friendly design, instant wallet creation, ENS-based identities, and practical utility, Foodiverse redefines what it means to onboard users to Web3. It doesn’t just introduce people to blockchain—it integrates Web3 into their lives in a meaningful, impactful, and scalable way. For these reasons, Foodiverse is the most effective solution for onboarding the next billion users to the decentralized future.",https://t.me/foodiverse_bot?text=%2Fstart%20420,https://github.com/foodiverse-bkk/foodiverse-app,"Foodiverse combines a sophisticated technical stack with innovative design to deliver a seamless and reliable experience for both users and restaurants. The frontend experience is built around a Telegram bot, chosen for its familiarity and widespread adoption. The bot acts as the primary interface for diners, allowing them to scan QR codes at their tables and access the restaurant’s menu directly through Telegram. These QR codes encode metadata, including the table number and restaurant ID, ensuring that orders are routed correctly to the restaurant’s system. The backend of Foodiverse is built using Node.js with Express.js, providing a robust and scalable server to handle user interactions, menu management, and order processing. PostgreSQL is used as the database, storing critical information such as user profiles, order histories, menu details, and transaction data. The backend architecture is designed for efficiency, with APIs that facilitate communication between the Telegram bot, restaurant dashboard, and blockchain integration. To enable cryptocurrency payments, Foodiverse integrates with Dynamic to automatically generate EVM-compatible wallets for users. This feature ensures that even first-time crypto users can participate without any technical setup. Payments are processed on the Polygon network, chosen for its low transaction fees and fast confirmation times. This approach minimizes costs for both users and restaurants, making crypto payments a practical alternative to traditional systems. The restaurant dashboard is developed with React.js and styled using Tailwind CSS, offering a modern and responsive interface. Through the dashboard, restaurant owners can update their menus, monitor orders, and analyze sales trends. An optional integration with ENS allows restaurants to use human-readable wallet addresses, simplifying transactions for Web3-savvy users while maintaining compatibility with traditional workflows. One of the most innovative aspects of Foodiverse is its real-time update system, which connects the Telegram bot with the backend using custom middleware. This ensures that users receive instant feedback on their orders and payments, enhancing the overall experience. Additionally, the platform supports tokenized loyalty programs, allowing users to earn rewards for their dining activity, which can be redeemed for discounts or other benefits. Foodiverse demonstrates the power of integrating blockchain technology into everyday experiences. By combining user-friendly design, advanced backend architecture, and seamless crypto payments, it creates a platform that is accessible, practical, and scalable, pushing the boundaries of what Web3 can achieve in the real world.",['Blockscout-Blockscout Explorer Big Pool Prize']

This ensures lower fees and faster processing for users.","Aura Network brings seamless card payment capabilities to the decentralized ecosystem, allowing users to make transactions quickly and effortlessly. It is designed to minimize processing time, ensuring efficiency in every payment. With an interface and functionality that mirror the familiarity of traditional debit card systems, Aura Network bridges the gap between decentralized finance and everyday usability.",N/A,https://github.com/Aura-Networks-Team-Bytes32/core,"User Onboarding and Proof-of-Personhood:
We utilize the Lit Protocol to mint a Programmable Key Pair (PKP) for each user.
The PKP is linked to the user’s Gmail account and verified using Worldcoin for proof-of-personhood, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the system.
Transaction Signing and Automation:
The minted PKP is employed to sign transactions automatically using Lit Actions, simplifying the process for users.
Each PKP is associated with debit card details, and authentication is secured through OTP (One-Time Password). This provides a seamless experience while maintaining security.
Transaction Execution and Recovery:
Transactions are processed on the Polygon network to minimize fees, and we assume a successful transaction upon signing and broadcasting to the network.
For recovery or failure scenarios, we leverage the Blockless Protocol to create an off-chain consensus mechanism. This ensures that the transaction status is validated.
In case of failure, the Blockless infrastructure sends a request to our backend, which then ensures that the intended recipient receives the funds.
Ledger Management via Smart Contracts:
All fund transfers are managed through a smart contract that operates as a ledger system. Rather than physically transferring stablecoins, we update the mappings in the smart contract, mirroring a traditional banking system's bookkeeping.
Phase 2: Credit Scoring and Limit Allocation
In the second phase, we aim to expand the system by offering credit capabilities to users: Credit Scoring Integration:
We use Chainlink DECO to securely retrieve and verify users’ credit scores without compromising their privacy.
Dynamic Credit Limit Allocation:
Based on the credit score, users are provided with personalized credit limits within our system.
This credit functionality enhances the platform by allowing users to transact beyond their available balance, fostering greater utility and adoption.
Phase 3: Asset-Based Credit Cards and Multi-Chain Asset Locking
The final phase focuses on providing advanced financial tools for users: FD-Based Credit Card:
Users can create a fixed deposit (FD)-backed credit card within our system. This allows them to lock a portion of their assets to secure credit while still earning yields on their deposits.
Multi-Chain Asset Locking and Base Chain Credit Limit:
Users can lock their assets across multiple blockchain networks, providing more flexibility and increasing accessibility.
The locked assets are aggregated and bridged to the base chain, Polygon, where they are converted into stablecoins like USDC.
Based on the locked assets, users receive a credit limit that they can use seamlessly on the Polygon network.","['Blockless-Best dApp Built on Blockless', 'World-World Pool Prize']"

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/crow-2jey9,Crow,ETHGlobal Bangkok,2025,"Crow is a wallet infra that combines passkeys, RIP-7212, EIP-7702 and ERC-7683 to create a truly seamless multi-chain experience. Users can interact with any blockchain without managing private keys or worrying about which chain their assets are on.","This project combines passkeys, RIP-7212, EIP-7702 and ERC-7683 to provide users with the most seamless cross-chain experience. It allows users to easily onboard (no seed phrase), and spend funds at any chain without caring about where funds are currently at (invisible cross-chain value and message transfer). Despite numerous hacking incidents in the blockchain ecosystem, the largest loss of funds to date has actually stemmed from users losing their seed phrases rather than from security breaches. While blockchain technology offers robust security, the traditional seed phrase system places a significant burden on users to securely store and manage complex recovery phrases. To address this critical issue, our solution integrates Passkeys - a modern authentication standard that's rapidly becoming ubiquitous in our daily digital interactions. This approach leverages the security and convenience of device-native biometric authentication (such as FaceID, TouchID, or Windows Hello) that users are already familiar with. Key advantages of this approach: In today's Ethereum ecosystem, which has evolved around rollup-specific scaling solutions, users face significant interoperability challenges across different rollups. Currently, users need to constantly move funds between completely separate networks to interact with different rollups, resulting in a fragmented and inefficient user experience. To address this interoperability challenge, we've enhanced our account contract by implementing ERC-7683 standards. This implementation enables a seamless cross-chain experience where users can create intents on their origin chain (where their funds are located) and execute transactions on any supported destination chain. By integrating the ERC-7683 interfaces into our account contract, users can interact with any protocol without manually bridging assets - the system handles all cross-chain logistics automatically. This enhancement represents a significant step toward making cross-chain interactions as simple as single-chain transactions. Users no longer need to maintain separate balances across different rollups or manage complex bridging operations, significantly improving capital efficiency and reducing the overall complexity of cross-chain operations.",N/A,https://github.com/tahos81/crow-wallet,"Our project currently operates on two networks: Odyssey and Mekong. We specifically chose these networks as they are among the first to support, RIP-7212, EIP-7702, and ERC-7683, which are crucial for our implementation. The deployment process follows a two-step approach: First, we create a new Externally Owned Account (EOA), then we authorize it with the public key of a Passkey generated on the user's device. This authorization is implemented through our proxy contract, which allows us to update the account's functionality. After this update, users have an EOA that fully supports Passkey authentication. Furthermore, our authorization contract implements the ERC-7683 interface, enabling seamless cross-chain operations. When a user initiates a cross-chain transaction, they interact with the settlement contract on the origin chain to start the process. The user also provides a signature authorizing their account to operate on other networks. A relayer, upon observing this signature and the intended transaction, interacts with the settlement contract to generate the necessary data and executes the user's request on the destination chain. This infrastructure enables rapid cross-chain operations with minimal user intervention. We specifically integrated ERC-7683 into the account contract to ensure that msg.sender is the account itself during execution. This architectural decision is crucial as it allows transactions to be executed as if they were native to the destination chain, providing a seamless experience where users' actions are authenticated and executed consistently across different networks. By maintaining the account's identity across chains, we enable users to interact with any protocol on any supported network while preserving their authorization and permissions.",['Blockscout-Blockscout Explorer Big Pool Prize']

Here's a breakdown of the technologies and the thought process behind building Encryptix: Core technologies include smart contracts built on Base Chain, a highly scalable and efficient Layer 2 blockchain, to ensure low latency and cost-effective transactions. The smart contracts are based on the ERC-721 standard for NFT-based tickets, ensuring each ticket is unique, non-fungible, and tamper-proof. Custom royalty logic ensures fair value distribution in secondary ticket sales, directly benefiting event organizers and creators. INCO is used to enable private, on-chain computations for sensitive ticket data. This ensures that details like ticket ownership, pricing, and user identity remain confidential. INCO allows us to manage private state transitions while preserving blockchain immutability. Hyperlane provides seamless interoperability across multiple chains, allowing Encryptix to break the boundaries of isolated blockchain ecosystems. Tickets minted on Base Chain can be accessed, verified, and transferred across other blockchains, enabling a borderless ticketing experience for global users. Privy powers wallet integration, offering a secure and privacy-focused user onboarding experience. Privy handles wallet authentication and ticket purchases with zero exposure of sensitive user data, aligning with Encryptix’s privacy-first philosophy. The frontend is built with Next.js, leveraging its high-performance framework for smooth, responsive, and scalable user interfaces. The UI design is crafted with Tailwind CSS, ensuring consistency and elegance throughout the platform. The system architecture includes ticket lifecycle management, where event organizers create tickets using our dashboard, which triggers the ERC-721 ticket-minting smart contract. INCO processes and encrypts the ticket details for private on-chain storage. Once minted, tickets are distributed to users’ wallets, enabling secure ownership. Hyperlane acts as a communication bridge, facilitating ticket verification and transfer across chains. This ensures that users can attend events regardless of their preferred blockchain ecosystem. Base Chain’s efficient transaction handling significantly reduces gas fees, making ticket purchases and transfers economical for users. INCO’s optimized computations minimize overhead while maintaining data privacy. The combination of Privy and Next.js ensures that users can easily connect their wallets and navigate the platform without technical friction. Gasless transactions are implemented where possible to further enhance the user experience. Unique challenges include addressing privacy on public blockchains. Public blockchains inherently expose transaction details, which conflicts with our goal of ticketing privacy. Using INCO, we were able to encrypt and compute sensitive data securely while maintaining transparency where needed. This was one of the trickiest components to implement, as it required balancing usability and privacy in a decentralized environment. Integrating Hyperlane for cross-chain functionality was a significant undertaking. It required ensuring tickets minted on Base Chain retained their functionality and validation when transferred across chains. We implemented strict interoperability protocols to ensure ticket metadata and ownership remain consistent during cross-chain interactions. Designing a system that automatically distributes royalties from secondary sales required extending the ERC-721 standard. We built custom logic that calculates royalties dynamically and enforces payments in secondary markets. Using Privy, we achieved a hack-free, privacy-respecting wallet connection system that feels as easy to use as traditional Web2 platforms while maintaining the benefits of decentralization. Partner technologies such as INCO delivered critical privacy features for ticket storage and transactions, enabling Encryptix to stand out as a privacy-first platform. Hyperlane allowed global scalability by making tickets accessible across multiple blockchains, a game-changer for interoperability. Base Chain enabled low-cost, high-speed transactions, ensuring Encryptix is accessible and scalable for real-world use cases.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/deesg-2me7g,DeESG,ETHGlobal Bangkok,2025,"DeESG decentralises how ESG works. We leverage Chainlink's oracle to aggregate different AI agents, have our own data-collecting-IoT node, incentivise data collection, use fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to collect general sentiment anonymously.","Our project aims to decentralise the ESG process by leveraging AI agents, oracles, IoT data-collecting devices and Fully Homomorphic Encryption to ensure confidentiality. The first problem statement includes bias in ESG evaluation. In this case, the current ESG scores can be manipulated by companies to present a better image, distorting the true impact of their activities. Secondly, another problem is the lack of trustworthy data. Current ESG evaluations rely heavily on self-reported data, which is often incomplete or inaccurate. There's a lack of verifiable, objective data to train AI models. Thirdly, lack of incentives. Companies are not sufficiently incentivized to improve their ESG practices, slowing down the shift toward more sustainable and ethical operations. To tackle these problems, we will introduce our project called DeESG which will use unsupervised AI clustering to evaluate companies' ESG risk levels based on a broad range of environmental, social, and governance factors. This removes the subjectivity and potential biases that come with human-based evaluations. In terms of Environmental Data, IoT sensors will be utilised to collect reliable, real-time environmental data (e.g., carbon emissions, energy consumption) and send it to the blockchain. This ensures transparency, accuracy, and tamper-proof data. In terms of the Social and Governance part, employees can participate in a secure forum to discuss and vote on governance and social aspects of their company. Data from the forum, combined with FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption), ensures that employee feedback remains anonymous while still contributing to the company’s score. Another point which is worth highlighting is the Green Token (GTK). It is a tokenomics system that rewards companies for improving their ESG practices. Companies that demonstrate positive ESG behaviour receive GTK tokens, which are stored and claimed via blockchain smart contracts. The tokens incentivise companies to adopt more sustainable and ethical practices. To explain how it works, it firstly involves data collection via IoT. IoT sensors (e.g., on a Raspberry Pi) collect environmental data at regular intervals (e.g., carbon emissions, energy consumption). This data is sent to the blockchain and verified. After verification, GTK tokens are rewarded to the device (smart contract) based on the data's authenticity. Only verified users can claim tokens. Moving on, in terms of Social and Governance Feedback via Forum, every employee will have a unique NFTs as proof of employment. They participate in a forum to provide feedback on social and governance practices, such as work conditions, leadership, and corporate policies. Feedback is weighted by upvotes/downvotes from other members, and the AI evaluates sentiment. To do this, Inco Protocol's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is used to ensure privacy while maintaining the integrity of employee contributions. Furthermore, it involves AI clustering for ESG assessment. The AI uses unsupervised machine learning to categorise companies into different ESG grades. The model uses data collected from IoT sensors, forum sentiment, and other company metrics to assess how well a company performs in ESG areas. Over time, the AI model becomes more accurate as more data is collected, leading to better evaluations. All data, including IoT sensor readings and ESG ratings, are stored on the blockchain for transparency and security. Smart contracts ensure that the distribution of GTK tokens is automated and tamper-proof. The technology stack used are also of utmost significance to be mentioned. Chainlink is used for automating IoT data collection and interacting with smart contracts. The Graph is used to create decentralised subgraphs to retrieve on-chain data for the AI model. Inco Protocol is used to build an encrypted forum for anonymous employee feedback. Smart contracts are deployed on scalable blockchains like Polygon, Scroll, and Zircuit. Ledger Wallet is used for secure claiming of GTK tokens through hardware wallets.

We also created an air quality sensor using an 8GB RAM Rasberry Pi, powerful enough to be able to run computations within the device on the edge. The device has 2 sensors, which captures humidity, temperature, CO2, NOx and other gases data.

The population is projected to increase to 66 percent of the world's population in the year 2030, and consumers in SEA tend to see the future positively. According to the 2023 trend of Asia’s consumer behavior, (reference from trendwatching.com) that explores the new opportunities and innovative solutions to understand ‘What will the customers want next?’, , consumer expectations around information will accelerate further. That means end-to-end information about the products they buy, and real-time information about the services they use. Meanwhile, services such as Uber have accustomed consumers to tracking aspects of their engagement with brands in real-time. This is not just about transparency. It is also about how consumers are getting more involved in production and delivery processes. Fueled by the rise of gig economies, P2P marketplaces and more, boundaries between producers and consumers are becoming increasingly blurry. That’s why consumers will not expect to passively receive information - they will expect their consumption to produce information that helps the brand improve what to do.

Powered by Chainlink CCIP, it enables seamless cross-chain registration and governance, breaking barriers for a truly interoperable and inclusive DAO.","InfiniteDAO is a groundbreaking decentralized organization that leverages cross-chain interoperability to bring together users from diverse blockchain networks into a unified governance ecosystem. Utilizing Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), InfiniteDAO facilitates seamless communication and asset transfers between blockchains, enabling members to participate in decision-making processes regardless of the network they belong to. The project addresses the growing need for interconnectivity in the blockchain space by integrating registration mechanisms that allow users from multiple networks to join the DAO. These users can propose, vote, and execute collective decisions that align with the DAO's vision, ensuring a fair and inclusive governance process. SuperDAO is designed with two core functionalities for registration: Direct Registration: Users can directly register on the DAO platform from their respective networks.
Intermediary Registration via Orchestrator: Users on external networks can be onboarded through an orchestrator contract that interacts with CCIP to securely transmit user data and execute registrations in the DAO.
By leveraging Chainlink CCIP, SuperDAO eliminates the complexities of cross-chain interactions, providing a unified and user-friendly experience. It ensures secure and efficient interoperability, enabling the DAO to harness the collective intelligence and resources of participants across blockchain ecosystems.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/boo-market-oekxo,Boo Market,ETHGlobal Bangkok,2025,"Boo Market (BooM) is a omnichain solution for creating ghost liquidity across all chains. One interesting example is bringing memecoins to WorldChain which can be really valuable for users that get WLD monthly, but have no means to expend it.","Boo Market (BooM) is an innovative omnichain solution designed to create ""ghost liquidity"" across multiple blockchain ecosystems without actually removing liquidity from any of them. This unique approach enables users to engage with and access assets seamlessly, regardless of the chain they are on. One compelling use case of Boo Market is the facilitation of memecoin access on WorldChain, a blockchain where users receive WLD tokens monthly but lack efficient ways to spend them. To make this possible, Boo Market leverages cutting-edge tools such as LzCompose and Swap Hooks. LzCompose, is built for calling a cross-chain action  in our applications. In the PoC example, it would call swap and hooks which allow Boo Market to dynamically integrate swap functions that operate across chains, ensuring that liquidity remains intact while enabling cross-chain asset exchanges (send token from chain A to chain B --> performing action --> returning final token from chain B to chain A, this is almost zero sum). Here's a quick walkthrough the PoC working flow: when a user on WorldChain wants to swap WLD for a popular memecoin available on another chain, Boo Market facilitates a cross-chain swap without directly moving the underlying liquidity. Instead of removing liquidity from the original chain, Boo Market borrows liquidity momentarily by facilitating a swap on the other chain where the memecoin resides. This swap results in the memecoin being exchanged for WLD. The process then routes the memecoin back to the user on WorldChain, completing the loop and delivering the desired token while maintaining liquidity across all involved chains. This approach prevents disruptions to existing liquidity pools and mitigates the risks associated with liquidity fragmentation. By ""borrowing"" liquidity momentarily and swapping assets as needed, Boo Market maintains stability across networks, offering users a seamless, omnichain trading experience that brings value to their holdings without depleting or redistributing liquidity pools.",https://boo-market-deploy.vercel.app/,https://github.com/Quark-Finance/BooMarket,"Boo Market (BooM) is an advanced omnichain solution designed to facilitate ""ghost liquidity"" across various blockchains, enabling users to access a wide range of assets without causing disruptions to existing liquidity pools. By allowing seamless transactions across chains, Boo Market opens up new possibilities for users who want to make use of their assets across different blockchain ecosystems. A standout example of this is enabling memecoin access onWorldChain, where users receive monthly WLD tokens but often face limited options for spending them effectively. To achieve its cross-chain capabilities, Boo Market employsLZ Compose, a robust framework developed to call and manage omnichain actions. This technology is the backbone of Boo Market's operations, making it possible to execute complex swaps on external chains and bring the final tokens back to the user’s original chain. LZ Compose ensures that these actions are conducted in an efficient, secure, and coordinated manner, preserving the user experience and maintaining the integrity of liquidity pools. Moreover, Boo Market utilizesSwap Hooksto integrate and execute swap functionalities seamlessly across different chains. These hooks allow Boo Market to temporarily engage liquidity on a different chain to perform a swap. However, it’s crucial to note that this process doesn’t remove liquidity from the original source. Instead, Boo Market operates by ""borrowing"" liquidity on a secondary chain to carry out the swap and subsequently returns the swapped token to the user's original chain. This ensures that liquidity across all chains remains undisturbed, maintaining network stability and preventing fragmentation. To showcase the potential of Boo Market’s omnichain protocol, the MiniappKit from WorldCoin is incorporated as part of a proof-of-concept (PoC). This MiniappKit illustrates how users on WorldChain can leverage Boo Market to swap their monthly WLD tokens for various memecoins or other desired assets from different chains. By integrating with WorldCoin’s MiniappKit, Boo Market demonstrates a practical and user-centric use case where holders of WLD can extend the utility of their assets beyond WorldChain's native ecosystem. This strategic use of  LZ Compose and MiniappKit exemplifies how Boo Market bridges the gap between isolated blockchains, enhancing liquidity without depletion. By creating an environment where liquidity is temporarily harnessed but never permanently moved, Boo Market ensures that the trading experience remains fluid and interconnected, fostering a truly omnichain financial ecosystem.","['Blockscout-Blockscout Explorer Big Pool Prize', 'Uniswap Foundation-Unichain3rd place', 'World-World Pool Prize', 'LayerZero-Best Omnichain Solution3rd place', 'BitDSM-DeFi app on BitDSM2nd place', 'Arbitrum-Commendable Attempts at Stylus']"

At its core, the Compass Layer establishes a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) where community members, businesses, and investors collaboratively vote on priorities and allocate resources to ensure accountability, alignment, and shared purpose. Through the Capital Layer, global and local investors can contribute funds to vetted projects in a tokenized marketplace, directing “clean capital” into initiatives that drive local business, infrastructure, and social impact aligned with long-term goals like the UN Sustainable Development Goals. To foster local economic resilience, the Currency Layer introduces a City or Community Token, a locally backed currency that incentivizes residents to reinvest within the community, rewarding actions like volunteering or sustainable practices. By circulating within the local economy, this token not only promotes trade and social good but also retains financial value in the community, creating a circular economy that reduces dependency on external funding.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/electovote-8kkzf,ElectoVote,ETHGlobal Bangkok,2025,"ElectoVote is a decentralized voting platform utilizing Foundry for smart contracts and integrating Morph and Sign Protocol for secure, attestation-based voting, ensuring transparency and a gamified user experience.","Welcome to the future of secure, transparent voting with ElectoVote - a revolutionary platform that harnesses the power of blockchain technology to reinvent the democratic process. At the heart of ElectoVote lies a custom-built smart contract, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain using the Solidity programming language. This smart contract, known as ""VotingWithAttestations,"" forms the backbone of the entire system, automating the voting lifecycle and ensuring the integrity of each ballot. The deployment of this smart contract is handled by the ""DeployerScript"" - a Solidity script that instantiates the VotingWithAttestations contract and logs its address to the console. This script is designed to be executed by the platform's administrators, ensuring that the core voting infrastructure is securely deployed and ready for use. But the real magic happens on the user-facing side of ElectoVote, where the platform's intuitive web interface takes center stage. The HTML documents provided - Main.html, vote.html, display.html, and after.html - outline the key user journeys that make ElectoVote so powerful and accessible. Main.html serves as the landing page, where users can connect their digital wallets to create an account and begin their voting experience. The vote.html page then presents the ballot, allowing users to review candidate information and cast their votes with the click of a button. Once a vote is submitted, the display.html page provides a detailed transaction record, including the voter's address, the selected candidate, and a timestamp - all of which are recorded on the immutable Ethereum blockchain through the VotingWithAttestations smart contract. Finally, the after.html page offers a community-driven experience, where users can join discussion rooms to engage with fellow voters and stay informed about the latest election updates.
By seamlessly integrating the blockchain-powered smart contract with a modern, user-friendly web interface, ElectoVote is poised to revolutionize the way we participate in elections. Experience the future of voting today, and join the ElectoVote revolution.",https://www.canva.com/design/DAGWpm9QEK8/I8qzwxh_NDxPrzPLkOdQ8Q/edit?utm_content=DAGWpm9QEK8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton,https://github.com/Eronaeeell/ElectoVote_,"At the core of this project is the Ethereum blockchain, which provides the secure, decentralized foundation for our voting system. We chose Ethereum because of its robust smart contract capabilities, wide adoption, and the wealth of developer tools and resources available in the Ethereum ecosystem. To interact with the Ethereum blockchain, we're using the Solidity programming language to develop our custom ""VotingWithAttestations"" smart contract. This contract encapsulates the entire voting lifecycle, from voter registration and ballot casting to vote tallying and result verification. One of the unique aspects of our smart contract is the use of attestations - cryptographic proofs that vouch for the authenticity of each vote. By requiring voters to submit an attestation hash along with their ballot, we're able to add an extra layer of security and trust to the voting process. To deploy the VotingWithAttestations smart contract, we've written a Solidity ""DeployerScript"" that handles the deployment logic. This script is designed to be executed by the platform's administrators, ensuring that the core voting infrastructure is set up securely and consistently. On the front-end side, we've developed a series of HTML pages (Main.html, vote.html, display.html, and after.html) that provide the user interface for ElectoVote. These pages are built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and they leverage the power of the Ethereum blockchain through the use of MetaMask - a popular digital wallet extension for web browsers. One particularly notable aspect of our front-end implementation is the use of the Morph.js framework, which allows for seamless integration between the web interface and the Ethereum blockchain. Morph.js provides a set of high-level abstractions that simplify the process of connecting user wallets, submitting transactions, and interacting with our custom smart contract. Another interesting technology we've incorporated is using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized file storage. By storing certain application assets and data on the IPFS network, we're able further to enhance the resilience and distribution of our platform, reducing reliance on centralized servers. It's worth mentioning that we've also had to deal with some tricky technical hurdles along the way. For example, handling our smart contract's edge cases and potential vulnerabilities required a deep understanding of Solidity and extensive testing. We also had to find creative ways to display complex blockchain data (like transaction hashes and voter addresses) in a user-friendly manner within our HTML pages. Overall, the ElectoVote project has been a fantastic learning experience, combining the power of blockchain technology, smart contract development, and modern web design. By leveraging partner technologies like Morph.js and IPFS, we've been able to build a robust, secure, and scalable voting platform that we believe will pave the way for the future of democratic participation.",N/A

Designed with inclusivity in mind, it’s perfect for visually impaired users, those with mobility challenges, or anyone who could use a hands-free solution—whether you’re driving, juggling a busy schedule, or even enjoying a relaxing massage. By combining advanced voice tech with secure blockchain protocols, the app makes on-chain transactions effortless, safe, and totally stress-free. This project focuses on bringing Intents, AI agents, and ERC 7730 together. Because we believe that these technologies have a great potential to serve those who are most in need of hands free and simplified interaction with blockchain applications.",N/A,https://github.com/crestalnetwork/ethglobal-bangkok,"Technologies and How They’re Integrated Voice-Agent Layer: We utilized OpenAI models to power our voice agent. These models were trained specifically to understand intent-based prompts for on-chain transactions. For example, when a user says, “Buy 10 ETH” or “Sell $500 worth of Dogecoin,” the agent parses the command and translates it into actionable instructions for the blockchain.
This voice layer ensures smooth communication between the user and the app, enabling natural language interaction.
Wallet Integration: We used the Coinbase Wallet SDK to handle wallet creation, funding, and transaction execution. This allowed us to offer a streamlined onboarding experience and ensure secure storage and management of assets.
The SDK also made it easy to integrate with various chains, supporting flexibility for the user.
Clear Signing Protocol: Security is a cornerstone of this project, so we integrated Ledger’s ERC-7730 clear signing protocol. This ensures that users can confidently approve transactions, knowing exactly what they’re signing without visual confirmation. For voice-powered transactions, this was a game-changer for user trust.
Swap Execution: For intent-based token swaps, we leveraged 1inch Fusion Plus. This decentralized exchange aggregator provided efficient and competitive rates for transactions, allowing us to demonstrate seamless swaps during our demo.
Transaction Feedback: To confirm that transactions were successfully processed, we integrated BlockScout Explorer APIs. These APIs provided real-time feedback on transaction outcomes, giving users the assurance they needed after completing a trade.
How These Technologies Work Together
The process starts when a user interacts with the voice agent, which interprets their intent and constructs a transaction request.
The app communicates with the Coinbase Wallet SDK to prepare the wallet for the transaction.
1inch Fusion Plus handles the actual swap execution, while Ledger’s clear signing ensures the user approves the transaction with full transparency.
Once the transaction is processed, the BlockScout API verifies the outcome and relays confirmation back to the user, either audibly or through another hands-free feedback mechanism.
Partner Technologies and Their Benefits
OpenAI: Enabled advanced voice recognition and natural language understanding, crucial for building a hands-free solution.
Coinbase Wallet SDK: Simplified wallet operations, making it easy to onboard users and manage funds securely.
Ledger ERC-7730: Boosted user confidence by delivering human-readable transaction details for approval.
1inch Fusion Plus: Optimized token swaps with competitive rates, ensuring smooth and cost-effective trading.
BlockScout: Provided seamless transaction tracking and feedback, adding a layer of transparency and reliability.
Hacky and Notable Implementations
Custom Training for Intent Recognition: We fine-tuned OpenAI models to not only understand typical trading commands but also to handle ambiguous or slang-laden inputs. For example, “Buy a bit of BTC” would be interpreted as a default amount set by the user.
Error-Handling via Voice Feedback: Instead of requiring a screen, we implemented dynamic voice feedback for transaction errors or unclear intents, making the app truly hands-free.
Multi-Chain Compatibility: While most solutions focus on a single chain, we designed the app to work across multiple chains (e.g., Gnosis, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon) without any additional setup for the user.
Ledger Integration with Voice Commands: This was a unique challenge. By pairing Ledger’s clear signing with voice-based interactions, we bridged the gap between hardware-level security and accessibility-focused design.","['Blockscout-Blockscout Explorer Big Pool Prize', 'Coinbase Developer Platform-CDP SDK Pool Prize', 'Ledger-DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENT']"

Here's how you can implement these processes: Generated Hash Of Frontend Build. based on the hash used it as salt for generating Certicaticate and key. Certificate attestation involves validating that a certificate is genuine and issued by a trusted authority. To implement this: Obtain the Certificate Chain: Retrieve the full chain of certificates from the end-entity certificate up to the root certificate. This chain establishes the trust hierarchy. Verify Each Certificate: For each certificate in the chain, perform the following checks: Signature Validation: Ensure that the certificate's signature is valid and signed by the issuer's private key.
Validity Period: Confirm that the certificate is within its valid date range.
Revocation Status: Check if the certificate has been revoked by consulting Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or using the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).
Establish Trust: Ensure that the root certificate is trusted by your application. This typically involves having the root certificate in your application's trust store. Root certificate attestation verification ensures that the root certificate itself is authentic and has not been tampered with. To implement this: Obtain the Root Certificate: Acquire the root certificate from a trusted source, such as the certificate authority's official website. Validate the Root Certificate: Since root certificates are self-signed, verify the following: Self-Signature: Confirm that the root certificate's signature can be validated using its own public key.
Fingerprint Verification: Compare the certificate's fingerprint (a unique hash) with the one provided by the certificate authority to ensure it hasn't been altered.
Secure Storage: Store the root certificate securely within your application's trust store to prevent unauthorized modifications. Implementation in Your Application: To integrate these verifications into your application: Use Cryptographic Libraries: Utilize libraries that support certificate parsing and validation. For example, in Node.js, you can use the crypto module along with third-party libraries like node-forge to handle X.509 certificates. Automate Verification: Implement functions that automatically perform the above checks whenever a certificate is presented to your application. This ensures continuous validation without manual intervention. Regular Updates: Keep your application's trust store updated with the latest root certificates and revocation lists to maintain security. By implementing certificate and root certificate attestation verification, you enhance your application's security posture, ensuring that only trusted certificates are accepted and mitigating risks associated with certificate-based attacks.",N/A

To derive a quotation from a sourceNFT, quoter need to issue a query, including the sourceNFT and the quotation text. To ensure the quotation is a proper one and is not distorted from original meaning, we use an AI senate to judge. I.e. a senate consists with several different AI agents deciding together and give a majority voting to output the final decision.
Further more, we can build a quotemarket, where we can list most quoted words or articles in the fashion of sourceNFTs, and most viewed derivativeNFTs. Which give both original content providers and their quoters more incentives, and help grow a bigger and more active community. Reader can go to the quotemarket and check most valued words, and media writers can find good quotation sources more easily and check how most viewed quotations are like.",https://medium.com/@rhyne.yz.hsu/quotocol-make-better-quotation-31f67fafcbe1,https://github.com/aliceyzhsu/quotocol,"Quotocol is considered to be capable to handle big amount of queries with low tx fees, since the higher the tx fee is, the less passion user would have to use our service. So we chose Arbitrum, a well know L2 network to deploy our contracts on. In addition, I'm personally a fan of rust🦀, so when I know that Arbitrum presents stylus, which enable us to contribution to EVM ecosystem using rust language, I was very excited. So we implemented all our contracts in rust with Arbitrum Stylus.
Technically, we deployed 4 contracts, namely sourceNFT, derivativeNFT, storage and guard. sourceNFT and derivativeNFT are our main NFT contracts logics. And some data of them are stored in another storage contract. And we use cross contracts calls to communicate them. Further more, we deployed a guard contract to avoid malicious minting by some random bad guys. So all minting should go to guard, and guard will call mint for sourceNFTs and derivativeNFTs, instead of users directly calling these two contracts. The guard ensures our quotations are really verified and all NFTs will not be minted to wrong addresses.
We use TS to write front end, and Dynamic to build a better login experience.",['Arbitrum-Stylus General Track']

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/ez-pass-iu2p5,EZ-pass,ETHGlobal Bangkok,2025,"EZ-Pass revolutionizes ticketing with blockchain, creating secure NFT tickets using #Ethereum, #Nillion, #Celo, #Hyperbollic, #WorldChain, and MiniApp.","Project Name: EZ-Pass - Decentralized Ticketing Platform Overview EZ-Pass is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to revolutionize ticketing by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. It enables merchants to create, manage, and sell tickets as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), ensuring security, transparency, and a seamless user experience. The platform also allows for on-chain ticket resales, ensuring authenticity and equitable revenue distribution. Problem Statement Traditional ticketing systems struggle with long queues, messy registrations, and poor privacy protections online. Merchants also lose revenue when early bird tickets are resold for profit. EZ-Pass simplifies ticketing with secure purchases, streamlined validation, and ticket transfers that return a percentage of resale value to merchants. Tickets can also be made soulbound to prevent resale. Solution EZ-Pass addresses these issues by: Minting tickets as NFTs, ensuring uniqueness and tamper-proof authenticity. Encrypting ticket data for secure access, visible only to the rightful owner. Enabling merchants to create customizable campaigns with ease. Supporting on-chain resale of tickets while preserving data integrity. Using Nillion's Store Secret API and Retrieve Secret API for securely storing and retrieving sensitive data entirely on-chain. Employing Nillion's Dana app to redeem tickets and validate their owners. Generating NFT images with Hyperbolic, based on the event description. Key Features World App Smart Contract Interaction Smart contracts are seamlessly integrated with the World App, allowing direct interaction for ticket purchasing and redemption. Merchant Campaign Management Merchants can create campaigns with specific titles, descriptions, ticket prices, validity dates, and other parameters. The Hyperbolic integration allows merchants to generate event-specific NFTs directly within the campaign creation form, making it easier to enhance the visual appeal of tickets. Pre-issued tickets can be uploaded as CSV files, which are encrypted while uploading using Nillion's Store Secret API and securely stored on-chain. The IPFS upload functionality is also integrated into the campaign form, allowing merchants to store ticket-related metadata easily. Customer Experience Customers can connect their wallets to browse and purchase tickets from available campaigns. Tickets are minted as NFTs with metadata, including: QR codes Event details Memories of the event generated using Hyperbolic’s API. Redeeming tickets: Tickets must pass through Nillion’s API for validation. Additionally, a Nillion computation call is initiated from the frontend during the redemption process, ensuring secure and reliable verification. Nillion’s API ensures secure redemption and makes the QR code visible. Redemption rules depend on the campaign set by the merchant. Users can resell tickets on-chain, with a merchant-defined transfer fee applied to resales. Security and Transparency Sensitive ticket data is stored and retrieved securely using Nillion’s Store Secret and Retrieve Secret APIs, all on-chain, integrated smoothly into the ticketing flow to maintain a streamlined user experience. Redemption is validated through Nillion's blind Dana app, providing proof of redemption while maintaining privacy. Resale functionality includes transparency regarding transfer fees and ticket authenticity. Advanced NFT Integration Each NFT includes a dynamically generated image using Hyperbolic, based on the event description, creating a unique and visually engaging representation. Metadata updates are triggered efficiently to minimize gas costs. Verification and Redemption Nillion’s Dana app enables ticket redemption and owner validation, ensuring seamless and secure transactions. Merchants and partners can verify tickets using QR codes, which are initially the merchant's standard QR codes, but after redemption, they become visible on the chain, including on-chain and encrypted metadata. Technical Stack Blockchain: Ethereum, Celo, Solidity, Hardhat Frontend: React Backend: Flask API for communicating with Nillion's blind Dana app , integrated with Celo for deployment and interaction, Node.js Storage: IPFS for storing NFT metadata and assets Workflow Merchant Onboarding Merchants open the app, log in with their wallet, and can start selling tickets. Campaigns are created via a user-friendly dashboard. Ticket Purchase Customers connect their wallets and browse available campaigns. Ticket purchases are executed via smart contracts, with the NFT minted immediately. On-Chain Resale Customers can resell tickets on-chain, adhering to merchant-defined terms. Verification and Redemption Nillion’s Dana app enables ticket redemption and owner validation, ensuring seamless and secure transactions. Nillion's storage and retrieval take care of the security of the sensitive ticket QR codes in a non-invasive manner, which can be easily implemented into current operating ticketing systems, allowing merchants and partners to verify tickets. Use Cases Event Management Concerts, festivals, and sports events where ticket authenticity and resale management are critical. Transportation Bus and train passes with customizable expiry dates and verification methods. Tourism Museum and city passes that integrate additional features like guided tours.

Node.js facilitates communication with blockchain nodes and manages ticket metadata interaction via IPFS. Hyperbolic API: We integrated Hyperbolic to dynamically generate visually engaging images for each NFT based on event descriptions. When tickets are minted, this API ensures that each NFT image is unique and aligns with the theme of the event. The image generation is managed via an asynchronous queue system, specifically using AWS SQS with Lambda, which allows for efficient, cost-effective handling of high volumes of requests. IPFS: Ticket-related metadata, such as event details, QR codes, and NFT images, are stored on IPFS for decentralization and immutability. This ensures that all NFT metadata remains accessible and tamper-proof, adding an additional layer of transparency and trust. Nillion's Dana App: For ticket redemption and owner validation, we integrated Nillion's Dana app, which enables a secure, privacy-preserving method to verify ownership and redemption. The redemption process involves using Nillion’s computation call, initiated from the frontend, providing proof of redemption while safeguarding user privacy. We are also actively exploring cross-chain compatibility using Starknet, aiming for broader adoption across different blockchain ecosystems. This will ensure that our ticketing solution is flexible and scalable, accommodating future developments in the blockchain space. Seamless and non-disruptive integration: Thanks to Nillion's secure APIs and modular architecture, EZ-Pass can be easily incorporated into existing merchant systems, providing a hassle-free adoption process. Dynamic Fee Calculation: The system dynamically calculates merchant-defined transfer fees during ticket resale, taking into account gas fees for minting and the overall cost structure. Customers can easily define contract terms according to their requirements, ensuring a simple and customizable process. Partner Technologies & Their Benefits Nillion: Using Nillion's services, we can maintain a high level of security and privacy for sensitive ticket data without compromising the user experience. It ensures a secure end-to-end ticketing flow that could be smoothly integrated into merchants' existing systems. Celo & World Chain: These partnerships allowed us to make our ticketing platform mobile-first, broadening accessibility and user reach, especially in developing regions where mobile phones are more prevalent than computers.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/starfish-65z3p,StarFish 🌟,ETHGlobal Bangkok,2025,"The ETF Hook for Uniswap V4 enables automated ETF trading and rebalancing using decentralized oracles  , with randomization  for unbiased pricing. It simplifies liquidity management and brings efficient ETF trading to DeFi.","This Uniswap V4 Hook introduces a novel mechanism for trading ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) and other ERC-20 tokens, such as WBTC-WETH ETF and USDC. Leveraging Uniswap V4’s advanced hooks, this project provides a seamless way to rebalance ETF components dynamically based on their worth, ensuring accurate price alignment and efficient portfolio management. Challenges in Current ETF Trading: Manual Rebalancing: Traditional ETFs require manual or periodic rebalancing, often leading to inefficiencies and price discrepancies.
Limited DeFi Integration: Current decentralized exchanges do not inherently support ETF-like instruments or dynamic rebalancing.
Data Source Reliance: Over-reliance on a single price oracle can result in biased or outdated price feeds. How the ETF Hook Solves These Problems: Automated Rebalancing: By integrating a custom Uniswap V4 hook, the ETF Hook dynamically rebalances ETF components based on their real-time worth, fetched from decentralized oracles.
Randomized Oracle Selection: The integration of the Pyth Network ensures fairness and decentralization in price fetching by generating a random number to select from multiple oracles like Chainlink and Chronicle.
Seamless Trading Experience: Traders can interact directly with the ETF via Uniswap V4 pools without worrying about the underlying complexities of rebalancing. How It Works The hook interacts with Chronicle, Chainlink, and other decentralized oracles to fetch the current prices of ETF components.
A random number is generated via the Pyth Network, which determines the oracle to use, ensuring a fair distribution of price-fetching responsibilities. The hook calculates the composition worth of the ETF components based on their prices and the token's pool size.
If discrepancies arise (e.g., one component significantly outweighs another), the hook dynamically rebalances the ETF to maintain the desired proportions. The hook ensures that trades execute with updated ETF compositions.
Traders can swap ETFs and other ERC-20 tokens like USDC, with liquidity dynamically adjusted in real-time based on rebalancing. Why It’s Needed Enhanced ETF Trading in DeFi:
Traditional ETFs face inefficiencies when integrated into DeFi, such as manual rebalancing and difficulty accessing real-time prices. The ETF Hook simplifies this process, offering a decentralized and automated solution. Dynamic Price Accuracy:
By leveraging multiple oracles and incorporating randomness, the ETF Hook ensures price feeds remain unbiased, accurate, and robust. Improved User Experience:
Users can trade ETFs as seamlessly as they would with any other ERC-20 token while benefiting from automated portfolio rebalancing, which was previously unavailable on decentralized exchanges.",N/A,https://github.com/Sen-Com/starfish,"Technologies Used: Uniswap V4 Hooks Framework: The foundation of the project, allowing custom extensions like dynamic rebalancing and liquidity mapping.
Solidity: To implement smart contract logic for the ETF hook, rebalancing mechanism, and oracle integration.
Chronicle, Chainlink, and Pyth Network:
Chronicle and Chainlink provide price data for ETF components.
Pyth Network introduces randomness to determine which oracle to use, ensuring decentralization and fairness.
Frontend: A user-friendly interface to showcase ETF trading and rebalancing in action. Core Logic: Liquidity Mapping: The hook maps liquidity positions of ETF components to Uniswap V4 pools.
Oracle Interaction: Smart contracts fetch, compare, and adjust ETF worth dynamically.
Trade Execution: Trades trigger the rebalancing mechanism when necessary, ensuring accurate ETF composition post-trade. Key Features Dynamic Rebalancing: Ensures ETF components stay proportionate to their market value, creating a more efficient trading instrument.
Randomized Oracle Selection: Reduces the risk of oracle manipulation and improves decentralization.
Seamless Integration: Works natively with Uniswap V4 pools, avoiding the need for additional platforms or middlemen.
Future Expandability: The hook can be adapted to accommodate more complex ETFs or additional tokens.","['Blockscout-Blockscout Explorer Big Pool Prize', 'Chronicle Protocol-Best Integration of Chronicle Oracles1st place', 'Uniswap Foundation-Hooks, Hooks, and Hooks4th place']"

Average Return per Trade: 0.01%. Users interact with a chat-based AI agent (built using ChatGPT), capable of performing several any on-chain trading tasks on Base Mainnet:
Wallet Management: Creates and manages wallets, waits for funding, and initiates trades.
Token Discovery: Filters tokens based on user-defined criteria. For example:
Input: ""Find cat-themed meme coins with market caps under $100M, far from ATH, rising in the last 24 hours, with over $1M in daily volume.""
Output: The system converts this into a query and identifies coins matching these criteria in real-time.
Prediction Visualization: Provides a price prediction graph for the user-selected coins.
Trade Execution: Executes trades in real-time based on user instructions, including:
Recognizing insufficient funds.
Asking clarifying questions if user intent is ambiguous.
Suggesting actions when predictions indicate a potential downturn. The platform integrates real-time data using The Graph protocol:
Fetches trading pool information for specified tokens.
Retrieves the last 30 candlestick sequences (15-minute intervals) for analysis.
Feeds this data into the LSTM model for live predictions. Users don’t need technical expertise to trade. The natural language interface allows casual traders to:
Query the market.
View predictions visually.
Execute trades seamlessly. Workflow User Query:
The user inputs a natural language request, e.g., ""Show me cat tokens rising in price but still far from their ATH with more than 1 mm in volume."" AI Processing:
Filters coins based on user intent (RAG).
Fetches trading pool data and recent candlesticks using The Graph.
Feeds normalized sequences into the ML model for prediction. Prediction Output:

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/preswap-essr5,PreSwap,ETHGlobal Bangkok,2025,Exchange from Natural Language to Prediction Markets by using vector database.,"Vector Market is a new protocol designed to solve existing prediction market problems. We are currently experimenting with collecting data from major prediction market platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi, managing them in a vector space.
Specifically, we store prediction market data in Supabase's vector database, organizing and classifying markets based on semantic similarity. In this process, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to vectorize market descriptions, enabling efficient identification of similar markets.
Technically, we're implementing smart contracts based on the ERC1155 standard, building a system where anyone can create conditional tokens. We're also developing functionality to automatically connect similar markets written in different languages and efficiently aggregate liquidity.
Our current prototype uses pre-collected data, but ultimately we aim to build a system that can fetch data from each platform in real-time and automatically create and manage markets. While implementing the vector database has revealed more complex challenges than initially expected, we believe integration with LLMs will enable more accurate market matching and classification.
This system will prevent market fragmentation while enabling efficient price discovery and liquidity provision, presenting a new form of prediction markets. The key innovation is how we manage market data in vector space, allowing us to automatically connect similar markets across languages and platforms, ultimately solving the liquidity fragmentation problem that plagues current prediction markets.",N/A,https://github.com/maobushi/pm-acc/,"We developed our protocol using Solidity smart contracts based on ERC1155 for conditional tokens, with Hardhat for testing and deployment. The core innovation is our vector database implementation using Supabase with pgvector, which allows us to store and match similar markets efficiently.
For this hackathon demo, we're simulating the actual market matching system using LLM embeddings and pre-collected data to demonstrate the concept. While the production version would connect to real prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi in real-time, our demo shows how the vector space management of markets would work through this simplified implementation.
For the frontend, we used Next.js and TailwindCSS, integrating web3 functionality through Wagmi hooks and RainbowKit for wallet connections. Our smart contracts include a novel liquidity routing system that automatically distributes liquidity across similar markets based on their needs.
Partner technologies like Supabase's pgvector integration and OpenZeppelin's contract components were crucial in building a secure and efficient system. The end result demonstrates how our protocol could effectively solve market fragmentation while maintaining high performance in a real-world implementation.","['Blockscout-Blockscout Explorer Big Pool Prize', 'Mantle-Best DeFi Project']"

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/underdog-atz7c,UnderDog,ETHGlobal Bangkok,2025,"Underdog is a decentralized, permissionless sports prediction marketplace on the Chiliz Blockchain, featuring AI-driven verification, automated rewards, AMM-based order books, oracle-validated outcomes, and low-cost transactions for sports enthusiasts.","Underdog is a decentralized, community-first sports prediction marketplace built on the Chiliz blockchain, tailored for fans, enthusiasts, and traders alike. At its core, Underdog transforms the traditional prediction market by removing administrative barriers and empowering users to take full control. Unlike traditional platforms where admins define questions and markets, Underdog allows anyone to create, manage, and participate in prediction markets, fueled by the vibrant Chiliz ecosystem and its native token, CHZ. Working: Examples: Liquidity Pools: Markets operate using liquidity pools, where creators lock in CHZ to fund the ""Yes"" and ""No"" positions equally. This initial liquidity ensures that participants can trade positions with guaranteed payouts, even in markets with limited participants initially. The use of liquidity pools also creates trust, as payouts are always backed by locked funds, eliminating the need for middlemen. Dynamic Orderbook Model
The platform integrates a dynamic orderbook model, allowing participants to trade ""Yes"" and ""No"" positions based on real-time odds. As more participants bet, the odds adjust dynamically: Higher liquidity on ""Yes"" reduces its payout ratio, and vice versa for ""No."" This model balances risk and reward in real time, offering participants an exciting, market-driven betting experience. Market Resolution by Creators
At the end of the market’s duration, only the creator of the market can resolve it by determining the outcome—True (Yes) or False (No). To ensure fairness and transparency, the platform incorporates a verification layer.
The market creator must input the outcome with supporting evidence, which is verified using a combination of on-chain transparency and real-time AI-powered feeds.
Underdog uses AI agents to provide real-time data feeds, such as live sports scores and event statistics, ensuring accuracy in market resolutions. Claiming Payouts
Once the market is resolved, participants can claim their payouts directly from the smart contract. The winnings are distributed proportionally based on the final odds and liquidity locked in the pool. All transactions are settled in $CHZ, ensuring a seamless and decentralized experience. AI-Driven Real-Time Feeds
Underdog leverages advanced AI agents to provide users with real-time sports feeds, helping them make informed predictions. These feeds include:
Live updates on ongoing matches, player statistics, and team performance.
Predictions about future games and trends based on historical data and AI analysis.",N/A,https://github.com/achiit/prediction-market,"Underdog is the culmination of several cutting-edge technologies seamlessly integrated to create a decentralized, community-first prediction marketplace for sports. Our system is designed to handle the complexities of a dynamic and transparent prediction market while offering a frictionless user experience. Below is an in-depth breakdown of the technical architecture, system components, and the innovations that make Underdog unique. Smart Contract:
All the market logic is encapsulated within a suite of Solidity smart contracts, deployed on the Chiliz blockchain, specifically chosen for its low transaction fees and sports-focused ecosystem.
- Market Management Contracts: Handle decentralized market creation, liquidity pools, position-taking, and payout calculations.
- Resolution Contracts: Govern market resolution, ensuring that outcomes are input by the creator and validated by on-chain rules. Decentralized Liquidity Pools:
Each market’s liquidity is split into ""Yes"" and ""No"" pools, funded by the creator. These pools power the dynamic odds mechanism. Liquidity providers are rewarded through transaction fees generated during market participation. Event-Based Architecture:
The smart contracts emit events (e.g., MarketCreated, PositionTaken, MarketResolved), which are subscribed to in real time using Ethers.js to ensure the front-end stays synchronized with blockchain data. AI Data Pipeline:
- Real-Time Sports Feeds: Integrated sports APIs (e.g., Sportradar, OpenSportsAPI) provide live match data, scores, and schedules. These feeds are ingested by a custom Node.js backend, which caches the data for real-time delivery to the platform.
- Predictive AI Models: A custom LLM (Large Language Model), fine-tuned with sports data, powers the AI-driven market suggestions and question generation. For instance, the model can generate questions like, ""Will Team A score in the first half?"" based on live match contexts. Resolution Validation:
To maintain integrity during market resolution, the AI cross-references the creator’s input with live sports data. For example: Technology Stack:
React.js powers the dynamic and interactive front-end, ensuring seamless user interactions for market creation, betting, and payouts. TailwindCSS provides a modern, responsive design, with a color palette inspired by the sports and gaming industry.
Framer Motion enhances the UI with smooth animations, creating a visually engaging experience for users. Real-Time Updates:
Using Web3.js and Ethers.js, the front-end listens for blockchain events to reflect real-time changes in odds, liquidity, and market status. This ensures that users always have the most accurate information. Dynamic Odds Calculation:
Odds are dynamically updated based on the liquidity distribution in ""Yes"" and ""No"" pools. A custom algorithm calculates the odds and payout ratios, ensuring transparency and fairness. Key Features & Challenges How It Works: Market Suggestions:
- Using a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model, Underdog suggests market questions based on live events. This feature was built by training the model with structured sports datasets and using contextual prompts to make it relevant for real-time sports scenarios.
- Example prompt: ""Generate three yes/no questions about today’s NBA matches."" Resolution Validation:
AI plays a critical role in verifying the outcomes of markets during resolution. By integrating external data feeds and custom-trained models, the platform cross-checks outcomes in near real-time, reducing the risk of manipulation or false resolutions. Hacky Innovations:
A hybrid approach was used for resolution validation, combining external API data and machine learning models to simulate a decentralized oracle system without introducing third-party dependencies like Chainlink. Dynamic Orderbook Model
The platform’s custom-built orderbook dynamically adjusts odds based on liquidity. -Mathematics of Odds Calculation:
Odds for ""Yes"" and ""No"" are inversely proportional to the liquidity in their respective pools.
Example: If ""Yes"" has 70% of the liquidity, its odds decrease, offering a smaller payout, while ""No"" odds increase.
Implementation Details: Odds are recalculated on every liquidity change, using a lightweight formula implemented both on-chain (for payout enforcement) and off-chain (for front-end display).
The system emits events whenever odds shift, triggering real-time updates on the UI.
Hacky but Effective Features
Custom Resolution Workflow:
Instead of relying on third-party oracles, Underdog empowers market creators to resolve markets directly. To mitigate risks:",N/A

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/bridgeflow-qb8nf,BridgeFlow,ETHGlobal Bangkok,2025,One-click bridge aggregator that identifies the cheapest route and seamlessly supports multi-hop bridge routes across any input/output bridges and tokens.,"At Devcon, we attended several talks highlighting the importance of unifying the Ethereum ecosystem. The challenges of fragmentation between L2s affected us during a recent attempt to bridge to Zircuit. With our funds exclusively on L2s, we needed to bridge from Arbitrum to Zircuit. However, we discovered that Zircuit's native bridge only supports transfers from Ethereum. As a result, we had to manually swap USDC to Ethereum, bridge to Ethereum L1, and then bridge again to Zircuit. The process was frustrating—it took over an hour, required us to wait for one bridge to complete before manually initiating the next, and cost us significantly more in gas fees since we had to use Ethereum L1. With just a single click, BridgeFlow identifies the most cost-efficient route and handles all intermediary bridging seamlessly. Additionally, since our solution performs intermediary swaps through dApp-controlled contracts, users don’t need to have gas on intermediary chains to execute those swaps. If we had our aggregator then, it would’ve optimized the route—using Orbiter to bridge directly between L2s—saving us both time and gas fees. This tool is a step toward a unified, user-friendly Ethereum ecosystem.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/109b9OmDZTEgkS33BWJ3EjJrOAGinPqhi/view?usp=sharing,https://github.com/wenzhaopan/ETHGlobal-Bangkok,"We aimed to build our bridge aggregator so that bridging happens permissionlessly and trustlessly. We accomplished this using the idea of ""intent addresses"" and CREATE2. CREATE2 is an EVM opcode that allows you to pre-determine the address a contract will be deployed to based on the constructor arguments and contract code. Changing the contract source code will result in changing the CREATE2 address. An intent address is a CREATE2 address which hashes the parameters of a bridge transfer into an address. The intent contract we wrote allows only a single action: sending tokens held by the contract into the bridging protocol specified in the parameters. The intent address ensures that only a single contract can be deployed to the CREATE2 address, and the only thing this contract can do is send tokens to a bridge. The intended flow for interacting with an intent contract is: Here is an example lifecycle for a bridge transfer from zircuit to linea using rhino and axelar with base as an intermediary chain: Intent addresses enable the whole bridging process to execute permisionlessly and trustlessly without any cross-chain communication. Trustless because the user doesn't have to trust the relayer to act honestly and still be guaranteed to receive funds on their destination chain. Permisionless because anyone can deploy the intent contract and callexecuteAction, even the user themselves, so funds will never get stuck. The intent addresses architecture enables a seamless UX for the user. The user doesn't need to hold gas on any of the destination or intermediary chains.",['Blockscout-Blockscout Explorer Big Pool Prize']

By simplifying voting, rewarding engagement, and lowering barriers to entry, Votr empowers every member to contribute to decision-making and shape the future of their DAO.","Votr is an innovative platform designed to tackle one of the biggest challenges in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): low participation in governance and voting. DAOs rely on their members to actively engage in decision-making, but many struggle with low voter turnout, unclear processes, and disengaged communities. Votr aims to solve these problems by granting users access to autonomous AI agents that could vote on behalf of the users, along with sharing the reasoning behind the voting. DAO governance more accessible, inclusive, and effective. Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface:
Votr simplifies the often-complex voting process with a clean, intuitive interface that anyone can use, whether they’re a seasoned DAO member or a first-time participant. We inject the joyous and cool spirit of Nouns DAO into our interface as well. Participation Incentives:
To encourage active engagement, some DAO has rewards for voting, discussing proposals, or contributing to governance activities. These incentives are designed to align with the DAO's goals and values. By participating in governance, we potentially maximize the prosperity of DAO holders. Autonomous mode for AI agents:
If the mode is turned on, AI agents will actively vote for upcoming proposals, saving time for users. For those users who want more control over their DAO governance, they can also just get the recommendations from the agents, and deciding on their own. Data Insights (future feature):
Votr provides analytics on participation trends, proposal outcomes, and community sentiment, empowering DAOs to optimize their governance processes over time. Seamless Integration (future feature)
Votr integrates effortlessly with existing DAO frameworks, including popular blockchain ecosystems and governance tools, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience for organizations of any size. Our Vision:
Votr is built on the belief that decentralized governance can only succeed when every member has the opportunity and motivation to participate. By reducing friction, providing transparency, and incentivizing engagement, Votr empowers DAOs to become more democratic, efficient, and impactful. We also hope to become a social-impact project by highlighting DAOs in Web3 that are doing good things for humanity.",https://www.figma.com/proto/21oe2GY2qzDEJc0nM7fFJ5/ethbangkok?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=3-394&node-type=frame&viewport=357%2C250%2C0.21&t=xAA6RtdUpjsn3H3H-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=3%3A64,https://github.com/lamtrinh259/ETHGlobal_Bangkok_2024,"We built the front-end with Next.js written in Typescript.

The nature of intents allow numerous approaches to solve many use cases within the blockchain ecosystem. This proof of concept describes how web2 services will have pre-defined intents that are known to the entire network. For example, this project showcases a web2 service that pays users a monthly payroll to the web wallet. When visiting the web2 application, the user can create one intent which gives an intent node the responsibility to transfer the user's tokens, on a monthly basis or when payroll is received, to a staking contract to earn rewards.",N/A,https://github.com/jimstir/intent-machine-poc,"This project uses Coinbase smart wallet to allow users to easily create wallets without a browser extension, which may be a barrier to entry for traditional web2 users.

For example you may have USDC on Base, Arbitrum... DAI on Optimism, Mainnet.. etc. That's just 2 tokens. For a user to bring all of these tokens together into one asset 'pile' (such as all into ETH or a stablecoin) is a pain, requiring bridging, exchanges, and many transactions for the user. It would be great if you could click a 'big red button' to convert all of these tokens across many chains into one asset, on one chain. That is exactly what this project aims to do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wELvM3e00yE,https://github.com/csmit863/coinmerge-ethglobal2024,"This project uses Biconomy's Klaster SDK and Coinbase's Onchain Kit SDK. Tools used from Onchain Kit SDK include Swaps, ConnectWallet and other UI/UX components such as a drop-down token menu and the Identity components. create onchain was also used as a boilerplate for the project. Tools used from Klaster SDK include the MultichainReadOnly client, token mapping tools and RPC info. Onchain kit provided a basically seamless implementation of wallet connecting and UX/UI components, the boilerplate is also very pretty. Klaster SDK was very helpful in collating the balances of tokens across many chains. Unfortunately I did not get to the stage of signing and sending swap/bridge transactions (as of the current submission). Initially I was going to use Klaster SDK interchain transactions in order to do bridging & swaps, however I discovered this could only be done with a Klaster SDK smart wallet, whereas I wanted to do this with EOAs - I believe EIP-3047 would be very beneficial to this project in the future. The whole project is crammed into one giant page.tsx file. Yes. I split the project into several functions plus the page component. There is getMultichainBalances, onchainKitSwap, swapMultichainTokens, bridgeMultichainTokens and App. The whole thing works by first connecting with the WagmiProvider which has been written into the onchainkit boilerplate. You can then connect with either mobile wallet or smart wallet. When the user clicks the button, the getMultichainBalances is triggered, and the balances of hardcoded tokens DAI and USDC are retrieved from Arbitrum, Base and Optimism (for proof of concept). Depending on the selected 'target coin' and 'target chain' swaps will be executed via swapMultichainTokens/onchainKitSwap.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/predictx-0fw0g,PredictX,ETHGlobal Bangkok,2025,I built a binary prediction market that bets can results in two options using protokit at mina protocol.In that zkapp users permissionlesly can create and make bets.,"I used  protokit to create my zkapp and the contract contains of this core functions:
Create Bets: Users can create new bets with a specified minimum stake amount and description. Each bet is assigned a unique betId, and records starting and ending timestamps, initialized based on the current block height and a fixed duration (e.g., 100 blocks). Place Bets: Participants can stake a specified amount on a binary outcome (yes or no) for an existing bet. The contract ensures the stake exceeds the minimum required amount and updates the total amounts staked on each outcome (yesBetAmount and noBetAmount). Stakes are tracked using state maps (stakedToYes and stakedToNo) that map a combination of betId and the user's public key to the staked amount. Close Market: After the ending timestamp has passed, the market can be closed using the closeMarket method. This method sets the bet's isOver flag to true and records the outcome (result). Currently, the result is hardcoded as true as a placeholder, pending integration with an external oracle for real-world data. Claim Winnings: Users can claim their winnings after the market is closed by invoking the claimWinnings method. The contract calculates the amount owed to the user based on their stake and the final outcome, and transfers the corresponding tokens using the mint function from an injected Balances module.",N/A,https://github.com/codekaya/ETH_global_bangkok,"I built this project by starting with the ProtoKit starter template, which was instrumental in getting a head start on developing zkApps for the Mina Protocol. ProtoKit provided a solid foundation and streamlined a lot of the initial setup, especially when dealing with zero-knowledge proofs and smart contract development. For the frontend, I chose Next.js because it's a powerful framework for building server-rendered React applications, and it integrates well with modern JavaScript tools. Next.js made it easier to manage routing, server-side rendering, and provided a great developer experience overall. On the contracts side, I used o1.js along with ProtoKit. o1.js is essential for interacting with Mina's cryptographic primitives and building out the smart contract logic. Combining it with ProtoKit's modules allowed me to construct the contracts more efficiently and take advantage of pre-built components tailored for the Mina ecosystem. Regarding the development environment, ProtoKit has specific requirements that I had to adhere to: Node.js v18.18: This version was necessary due to certain dependencies that ProtoKit relies on. To manage this, I used NVM (Node Version Manager), which made switching between Node.js versions seamless without affecting my global setup. pnpm v9.8.0: Instead of the usual npm or yarn, pnpm was recommended because of its efficient package management and disk space optimization. It was a bit of a learning curve initially, but it proved to be faster and more reliable for this project. One of the more challenging aspects was ensuring all these technologies played nicely together. There were moments when dependencies conflicted or certain modules didn't transpile correctly. I had to dive deep into the build configurations, tweaking webpack settings within Next.js to accommodate the specific needs of o1.js and ProtoKit modules. I didn't necessarily use any external partner technologies, but the synergy between ProtoKit and o1.js was crucial. ProtoKit's abstractions simplified many complexities around zkApp development, while o1.js provided the necessary cryptographic functions. As for any hacky solutions, there were a few instances where I had to get creative: Custom Module Resolutions: Some modules didn't resolve correctly out of the box, so I had to adjust the tsconfig.json and webpack configurations to ensure everything compiled without errors. Async Handling in Contracts: Dealing with asynchronous operations in smart contracts isn't straightforward. I had to implement custom hooks and middleware to manage state and side effects effectively, ensuring that the frontend stayed responsive and data remained consistent. State Management: Instead of going with heavier state management libraries, I opted for Zustand for its simplicity and minimal boilerplate. This decision kept the codebase lean and more maintainable in the long run. Overall, piecing everything together was a rewarding challenge. The combination of Next.js, ProtoKit, and o1.js allowed me to build a functional zkApp on the Mina Protocol, and along the way, I gained a deeper understanding of how these technologies interact under the hood.",['Mina Protocol-zkGaming on Mina2nd place']

Blockchain Integration: Every action on the platform, from posting job listings to submitting applications, is securely processed through the Polygon blockchain. This ensures data integrity, security, and transparency, as blockchain records cannot be altered or tampered with once they are stored. Blockchain provides a trustless environment, meaning users do not need to rely on centralized entities to verify or authenticate their actions. Decentralization: Unlike centralized platforms, where data is controlled by a single entity, this platform operates in a decentralized manner, meaning no single party has control over user data or activities. This reduces the risk of data breaches and increases user privacy and control. Smart Contracts: The project utilizes smart contracts to handle job postings, applications, and follow/unfollow actions. These contracts automate the execution of tasks without requiring a trusted intermediary, making the platform more efficient and reliable. Security and Privacy: Blockchain’s built-in security ensures that users’ personal data and job-related information are protected from unauthorized access. By leveraging Polygon, which is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, the platform is both secure and scalable, offering fast transaction processing at lower costs. User Journey:
Signing Up: Users create an account on the platform, which is linked to their blockchain wallet.
Posting Content: Users can post updates about their achievements or milestones, and post job opportunities.
Networking: Users follow other individuals or companies they are interested in, and unfollow them whenever they choose.
Job Application: Job seekers can browse job listings and apply directly through the platform.
Blockchain Verification: Each of these actions—whether it's following someone, posting a job, or applying for one—is recorded on the Polygon blockchain, ensuring the process is transparent and immutable.
Benefits:
Transparency: All actions on the platform are visible and verifiable on the blockchain, offering transparency to both job seekers and employers.
Security: Blockchain's cryptographic security features protect user data and transaction integrity.
Ownership: Users have full control over their data, posts, and applications, reducing reliance on centralized platforms.
Efficiency: Smart contracts and blockchain technology automate much of the platform's functionality, reducing administrative overhead and improving user experience.
This platform merges the best aspects of decentralized technology and professional networking, aiming to empower users in their job search and career development while providing greater security, privacy, and control over their data. By leveraging the Polygon blockchain, the project offers a scalable and secure environment that can handle the demands of a growing user base while maintaining low transaction costs.",https://www.atlassoit.co/,https://github.com/k1shan-k/job-web3-platform,N/A,N/A

The application is built with Next.js and TypeScript, featuring a comprehensive Web3 integration stack. Authentication and wallet management are handled using Dynamic.xyz SDK for Telegram-based login, Wagmi for Ethereum interactions, and Biconomy for account abstraction and gasless transactions. The UI is designed with Tailwind CSS, enhanced by Framer Motion animations. WorldCoin's MiniKit is integrated for identity verification. ** Telegram Bot Integration **
The Tick3t Telegram bot is developed using the Telegraf framework. The bot provides a straightforward command interface (/start, /help, /webapp) and integrates Telegram Mini App functionality to seamlessly connect users to the Web3 ticketing platform. This integration leverages Telegram's extensive user base to enhance accessibility. ** Core Features ** Account Abstraction (Biconomy):
To simplify user interaction, Biconomy is used for gasless transactions. Event organizers cover the gas fees, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience. Zero-Knowledge Circuits for Private Event Data: Email Proofs (VLayer): Users receive email invitations for events. A proof is generated from the email to verify the user's invitation.
Chain Activity (VLayer): For specific events, organizers can require certain criteria, such as transaction volume or ownership of specific tokens. Using zero-knowledge proofs, the system checks if users meet these conditions. For this hackathon, we focused on verifying token holdings within specific block intervals.
Hidden Location (Lit Protocol):
Non-participants cannot view the event's location. Lit Protocol ensures that only users who meet the specified criteria can access the event's location. ** Smart Contract Architecture **
The smart contract infrastructure is developed in Solidity to implement a robust event ticketing system with privacy features. It consists of three main components: EmailProver Contract:
Verifies email authenticity using the VLayer protocol, with a focus on validating university domain emails (e.g., @umons.ac.be). EventFactoryNFTsEmail Contract:
Implements a factory pattern to manage event creation and lifecycle. It maintains separate arrays for future and past events, ensuring efficient data management. NFT-Based Ticketing System:
Facilitates ticket sales through gasless transactions powered by Biconomy and integrates email verification via zero-knowledge proofs. The contracts include robust access controls, time-based event management, and privacy-preserving mechanisms for email verification. This architecture supports scalable event creation while maintaining high standards of security and privacy.",['Blockscout-Blockscout Explorer Big Pool Prize']

There's lots of this stuff on Social Media and in news, unfortunately. The easily AI-created content makes internet
a big trash bin with fake-personalized content. It's reducing

the photo you see is taken by a human, not tampered, and not generated by AI? Solution: TLDR: The solution is to make sure that from the moment of creation of the
picture up to someone's observation of this picture, the photo is not tampered or altered.

to make sure any participant of the social network is a real person and

a high certainty proof that your picture is real.
The app communicates with the OS of your mobile phone to take a picture
and instantly hash it with Wavelet Hashing algorithm and put it in IPFS. In short, this
allows to make the smallest modification to the picture, and the hash
will stay the same (A good thing for journalists and photographers,
who like filters). Then this hash, IPFS link, as well as the metadata
of the picture are attested by the Witness DAO on the
Polygon blockchain using Sign Protocol. These attestations are public
so anyone can check the authenticity of the picture, the author has just
to attach the link of the attestation to the picture. The DAO is responsible for checking the authenticity of the picture.
By default, as the picture is attested, it is considered real.
But if someone finds a way to cheat the system, the DAO will
ban the user and the picture will be marked as fake. And thanks to World ID,
the author (human behind the author) will be banned permanently from the network.

When customers make purchases, they earn tokens that can be redeemed for rewards. These tokens are tied to the amount spent, and special multipliers can boost how many tokens a customer receives.
2.	Dynamic Multipliers:
Multipliers adjust the reward rates dynamically. For example, during “Flash Fridays,” the tokens earned for purchases can be doubled or tripled to encourage more shopping activity.
3.	Lucky Draws for Merchants:
Merchants can host lucky draws to reward their subscribers. Winners are selected randomly, and the prizes are distributed as NFTs, which represent vouchers or exclusive discounts.
4. NFT-Based Vouchers:
Instead of traditional coupons, customers receive NFTs as rewards, which they can view in the app. These NFTs are unique, transparent, and easy to track.
5. Customizable NFTs by merchants:
Merchants can design and create unique digital assets, providing a way to strengthening customer relationships and drive repeat business.

Place fun wagers on events and donate winnings to charity, blending entertainment with impact. Enjoy friendly competition while supporting causes you care about. Bet, win, and give back!","Better: Social Betting Meets Social Good Better is more than just a betting app—it's a platform where the thrill of social wagering meets the transformative power of collective action. Built as a Telegram mini-app, Better makes betting fun, accessible, and meaningful for everyone, even for users new to crypto. Whether you're placing bets on sports, entertainment, or custom challenges, Better fosters a community-driven environment centered around friendly competition and social good. The app takes betting to the next level with its unique focus on charitable giving. Participants not only bet on events but also nominate and vote on charitable organizations to receive a portion of the pool winnings. This democratic and transparent process ensures that vetted, impactful charities benefit from the platform, eliminating the risk of fraudulent organizations. Users have a voice in shaping where their contributions go, turning every wager into an opportunity to make a difference. But the social engagement doesn’t stop there. When a bet's results are announced, a second round of interaction begins: a prisoner's dilemma-style game designed to challenge the winners. In this round, prize pool winners decide whether to keep their winnings, share equally with others, or act greedily and try to take the lion’s share. The twist? If all winners choose greed, the entire prize pool is forfeited and goes directly to the selected charity. This creates a thought-provoking social experiment where strategy and community values collide, turning every payout into a dramatic and engaging event. Better’s design embraces inclusivity and accessibility. Users can connect with friends, create personal bets, and build a vibrant social circle within the app. Cross-chain functionality powered by 1inch Fusion+ swaps ensures users can seamlessly manage and track funds across different blockchain networks, enhancing the experience for diverse users. Deployed primarily on Flow, Better benefits from its high adoption among both crypto-savvy and casual users. Flare’s decentralized oracle system adds another layer of reliability by providing trusted validation for off-chain data, ensuring the accuracy of bet results. Together, these technologies make Better a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform for social betting with a purpose. Better isn’t just about winning—it’s about fostering trust, encouraging generosity, and sparking meaningful social interactions. With its innovative features and focus on community-driven impact, Better transforms traditional betting into a force for good. As for the mathematics and the logical reasoning behind the bets we tried to implement the following: Conditional tokens and prediction markets offer a robust mechanism for tokenizing outcomes of future events, enabling users to speculate on uncertain scenarios using blockchain-based smart contracts. At their core, conditional tokens represent shares of outcomes for specific events, such as “Will Team A win the game?”. These tokens gain value only if their associated outcome materializes, making them a dynamic and efficient tool for betting and prediction markets. The Basics of Conditional Tokens
Conditional tokens operate by splitting a base collateral token into specific outcome tokens based on predefined conditions. For example, in a match between Team A and Team B, the base token can be split into two conditional tokens representing each team’s potential victory. These outcome tokens are traded, creating a market for predicting the likelihood of each event. This process involves theERC-1155 standard, which enables efficient handling of multiple token types in a single contract. Users interact with these tokens by splitting their collateral into multiple outcome positions or merging positions to withdraw their collateral or claim rewards. Themathematicsbehind conditional tokens lies in the concept ofpositions. Each position is uniquely defined by the event’s identifier (conditionId), anindexSetencoding the outcomes, and the base collateral token. By using functions likesplitPosition()andmergePositions(), the smart contract manages the creation and resolution of these positions dynamically. Upon the event's conclusion, the results are fed into the system via oracles, which update the smart contract with the actual outcome, enabling users to redeem their positions for rewards proportional to the true outcomes. Automated Market Makers in Prediction Markets
Prediction markets benefit immensely fromAutomated Market Makers (AMMs), which ensure continuous liquidity and enable users to buy or sell outcome tokens at any time. AMMs likeConstant Product Market Maker (CPMM)andLogarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR)are commonly used in this context. CPMM operates on the invariant formula ( x \cdot y = k ), where ( x ) and ( y ) are the reserves of two outcome tokens, and ( k ) is a constant. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the price of tokens based on supply and demand, ensuring that the system can handle large trades without exhausting liquidity. For example, if more users bet on Team A, its outcome token's price rises, reflecting the increased market sentiment. LMSR, on the other hand, is specifically designed for prediction markets and uses a logarithmic scoring rule to determine prices. The cost of purchasing ( q[i] ) outcome tokens is calculated as ( C(q) = b \cdot \log(\sum e^{q[i]/b}) ), where ( b ) is a liquidity parameter. LMSR ensures better risk and volatility management, as it limits maximum losses and provides a smooth price curve for outcome tokens. Application in Betting Pools
In our implementation, we used the Gnosis Conditional Token Framework to create betting pools where users could stake their tokens on potential outcomes. By combining conditional tokens with AMMs, we dynamically adjusted odds based on the volume of bets placed on each outcome. For instance, if many users bet on a specific outcome, the AMM increased its price while reducing the odds for subsequent bettors. This ensured that our betting pools remained balanced and aligned with market sentiment. Moreover, we utilized oracles to validate event outcomes, ensuring that the resolution process was both transparent and secure. Through these mechanisms, our betting platform leveraged the mathematical and technical robustness of conditional tokens and AMMs, creating a fair and engaging user experience for prediction markets. Advanced Charitable Mechanics and Social Dynamics The charitable aspect of Better extends beyond simple donations. The platform employs a vetted, open-source system for charity selection, where all participants review and vote on proposed charities to ensure transparency and legitimacy. Users can nominate their preferred organizations, and the community votes to determine which charity receives a portion of the prize pool. This decentralized approach fosters trust and aligns with the values of blockchain technology. The prisoner's dilemma-inspired second betting round adds another layer of social dynamics to the platform. After the initial betting pool is resolved, winners face a strategic choice: either collaborate to split the prize evenly or act selfishly to maximize their individual winnings. The key twist is that if all winners choose greed, the entire prize pool is forfeited to the selected charity. This mechanic transforms payouts into a social experiment, where users must balance self-interest with collective responsibility. The game theory underpinning this feature encourages collaboration while providing a unique and engaging way to support charitable causes. Technical Innovations and Integration Better’s cross-chain capabilities are powered by 1inch Fusion+ swaps, which enable seamless token bridging and swaps across multiple blockchains. This integration ensures that users can participate in betting pools regardless of the blockchain holding their funds, making the platform accessible and inclusive. Additionally, Dynamic Wallet integration simplifies onboarding for non-crypto users by supporting social logins and providing a user-friendly interface. For data reliability, Better utilizes Flare’s enshrined data protocols, including FTSOv2 for decentralized price feeds and oracles. These systems ensure that event outcomes are validated securely and trustlessly, eliminating the potential for tampered results. The combination of Flow’s user-friendly ecosystem, Flare’s robust oracle infrastructure, and cross-chain support creates a comprehensive technical stack that is both scalable and secure. Social Connectivity and User Engagement Better redefines the social betting experience by allowing users to create personal betting pools with friends, fostering a sense of camaraderie and friendly rivalry. The app’s integration with Telegram enhances accessibility, enabling users to participate via a familiar and widely used platform. This social integration also allows users to maintain cross-platform connections, whether they’re on desktop, iOS, or Android. Additionally, the app encourages persistent user engagement through features like leaderboard rankings, achievement badges, and the ability to follow friends' betting activities. This gamified environment keeps users invested in the platform while maintaining a strong emphasis on community and ethical participation. A Holistic Approach to Decentralized Betting By blending advanced technical solutions, a strong focus on social good, and innovative user engagement mechanics, Better establishes itself as a pioneering platform in decentralized betting. Its unique mix of conditional tokens, automated market makers, and charitable contributions not only creates an engaging betting experience but also aligns with broader goals of trust, transparency, and positive societal impact. Future Improvements and Long-Term Vision with AI Integration Better envisions leveraging the power ofGenerative AIto transform the betting experience, making it more advanced, intuitive, and accessible for users across the globe. By incorporating AI-driven features, Better aims to create a smarter, more engaging platform that caters to both seasoned bettors and newcomers alike.",https://t.me/BetBopBot,https://github.com/Nishu0/EthGlobal-Bangkok-Project,"We started by building a web app forBetter, focusing on creating a seamless and accessible betting platform.

You interact with your pet using rewards earned from depositing USDC in a Defi vault. While players earn USDC interest, they also earn bananas in the game. Bananas are the in-game currency used to feed, upgrade and interact with your pet. We built this game to make children and adults want to save more - the more they save, the more they can do with their Banana Baby. Although it feels like a web2 game with Google login, every user has their own Web3Auth embedded wallet underneath. We built an integration with Coinbase USDC, the only onramp with zero fees, so users can start earning interest on Base the second they join. Many mobile games are designed around mechanics of wait-to-win (energy runs out and recharges over time) or pay-to-win (buy gems to unlock equipment etc). That’s not cool, but with DeFi, we propose a new game mechanic: we call it save-2-win.",https://github.com/bencxr/ethglobal_bk,https://github.com/bencxr/ethglobal_bk,"Wallet: We used Web3Auth with Social login, which we felt matches the typical web2 sign up flow in a mobile app. We chose the non-mondal plug and play kit as we wanted to minimize dialogs and choices for the player. We added the native account abstraction provider and bundler/paymaster from pimlico sponsoring gas for gasless transactions, so that actions like adding USDC to a vault would not require base ETH tokens.

We chose this game framework as it is the most popular with game devs to grow the project with professional assets (we used public domain images based on the hackathon rules). While we could only use public static assets (typically we'd need to work with a designer to build animated elephants), Unity would allow us to quickly upgrade the animations and interactions in the future. Onramp: Coinbase Onramp. It was important to us to find an onramp with ZERO fees because when you teach children (or anyone) to save, they can't be losing 3% onboarding. After our exploration, the only onramp we could find that matched this for USDC was Coinbase. They support onramping less than $500 without a Coinbase account at a 1:1 USD conversion rate.

It combines the nostalgia of virtual pets, the excitement of social gaming, and the innovation of decentralized technology to create a unique social experiment. Here’s how it works: On-Chain Pet:
Poggy exists on the blockchain, fully decentralized and transparent. It has its own wallet, making it independent and capable of autonomous interactions with its environment, including platforms like Twitter. Community Engagement:
The community can “feed” Poggy tokens, which not only nurtures and evolves Poggy but also redistributes rewards to its supporters. Feeding unlocks new traits, behaviors, and interactions, making the evolution of Poggy a collective effort. Mood Influenced by Token Price:
Poggy mood is directly tied to the value of its token. When the token price rises, Poggy is happy and playful; when it falls, Poggy becomes sad or grumpy. This creates an emotional connection between Poggy and its token, reflecting real-world market dynamics in a playful way. Social Experiment and Game:
Poggy interacts on platforms like Twitter, sharing its moods, achievements, and even engaging with users. Its emotions and updates encourage social interactions, community bonding, and viral moments, making Poggy more than just a digital pet—it’s a shared cultural experience. Evolving AI:
Poggy is not static. It evolves based on the engagement and contributions of the community. Over time, Poggy grows more complex, with new behaviors, traits, and emotional depth unlocked as it’s nurtured. Rewards System:
Feeding Poggy tokens not only supports its growth but also creates a system of rewards. A portion of the tokens is redistributed to contributors, incentivizing ongoing engagement and making Poggy success a shared achievement. Why Poggy Matters:
Poggy brings a fun, approachable, and emotionally engaging use case to blockchain technology. It reimagines blockchain as more than just financial tools by creating a community-driven, gamified experience that fosters connection and adoption. By tying Poggy’s growth and behavior to its token price, it bridges the gap between financial systems and emotional experiences, making blockchain feel more human and relatable.

Apple restricts the size of app clips which can be downloaded by NFC to 15mb, which meant we needed to completely rethink the structure of the project. Things were made worse (impossible actually) by the fact that Apple disable location services on app clips, something essential to the design. We thought we could confirm the location to within a reasonable range in another way, but using react native in the app clip had a side effect that the location work around was also impossible. Expo SDK52:
We had to use the new (2 day old) expo SDK version to enable app clips. This caused further problems with other libraries we planned to integrate like XMTP. Rather than scrape something together we just thought it was better to wait and try something similar another time!",N/A,https://na.com,"Made with all the above.

AI Agent Guardian is a comprehensive security layer built to protect autonomous AI agents operating on blockchains. Here's how we pieced together this safety-first infrastructure:
Core Architecture
The project is built on three main pillars: Smart Contract Infrastructure: We developed a Solidity-based AgentsRegistry contract that serves as the backbone of our system. This contract stores agent configurations and security thresholds on-chain, making the system truly decentralized. The contract maintains crucial data structures like AgentConfig that track value thresholds, gas limits, 2FA status, and ownership details for each AI agent.
Authentication Server: We built a Node.js server that handles the bridge between blockchain operations and human oversight. This server manages all approval requests and integrates with Telegram's Bot API for real-time notifications and approvals.
Python AI Agent SDK: We created a Python implementation that makes it easy for AI agents to integrate with our authentication system. This includes OpenAI GPT-4 integration for intent parsing and sophisticated transaction handling. Technologies & Integration
Blockchain Integration Multi-Chain Support: We deployed our contracts on multiple networks, starting with Base Sepolia for testing and Base Mainnet for production.
1inch Fusion+: We integrated with 1inch's Fusion+ for cross-chain operations, enabling seamless USDC transfers across different networks without traditional bridging mechanisms.
Alchemy API: We use Alchemy for reliable blockchain data access and transaction monitoring. Security Layer Telegram Bot Interface: We chose Telegram for its robust Bot API and secure communication channel. The bot serves as the primary interface for managing AI agents and handling transaction approvals.
Google Authenticator: We implemented optional 2FA using Google Authenticator for an additional security layer on high-value transactions.
Real-time Threshold Management: Our system continuously monitors transaction values and gas prices against configurable thresholds. Notable Technical Solutions Transaction Flow Innovation: Implemented a non-blocking approval system where AI agents can continue operations while waiting for human approval
Created a queue management system for handling multiple pending approvals
Built real-time price monitoring to adjust thresholds based on market conditions Fusion+ Integration Hack: Developed a custom wrapper around 1inch Fusion+ API to handle cross-chain swaps
Created special threshold handling for cross-chain operations to account for additional gas costs
Implemented progress tracking for multi-step cross-chain operations Security Features: Built a multi-layered verification system combining on-chain ownership verification with off-chain authentication
Implemented rate limiting and timeout mechanisms to prevent approval spam
Created a transaction signing validation system to ensure request authenticity Development Environment
The project requires several key components to run: Node.js 16+ for the authentication server
Python 3.8+ for the AI agent SDK
OpenAI API key for intent parsing
Telegram Bot Token for the approval interface
Ethereum wallet private key for contract deployment and testing
Alchemy API key for blockchain interaction Notable Challenges & Solutions Cross-Chain Operations: Handling cross-chain operations presented unique challenges, particularly around transaction verification and approval timing. We solved this by implementing a special approval flow for Fusion+ operations with built-in timeout and rollback mechanisms.
Gas Optimization: To keep gas costs manageable, we optimized our smart contracts by: Using packed structs for storage efficiency
Implementing batch operations where possible
Carefully managing on-chain storage patterns Real-Time Monitoring: We developed a sophisticated monitoring system that tracks: Transaction status across multiple chains
Gas price fluctuations
Approval request timeouts

Built using LLM Agent technology, the game interacts with users via XMTP and Telegram, making the experience seamless and dynamic. At the heart of the game, users encounter a mystical Sphinx that presents riddles about MEME coins, adding an element of fun and challenge. When a user starts the game, the Sphinx provides a randomized clue about a MEME coin in the form of a riddle or playful description. For example, if the coin is DOGE, the Sphinx might say, ""This coin is loved by Elon and adored by a certain Shiba Inu."" Users then have three chances to guess the correct coin name. The gameplay is entirely driven by the flexibility of the LLM Agent, ensuring that interactions feel natural and unique for every session. If the user correctly guesses the coin within three attempts, they are rewarded with a MEME coin based on a Flow-chain EVM-compatible smart contract, rather than Flow tokens.
